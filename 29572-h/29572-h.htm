<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>THE WRECKING BOSS</h3>
</div>
<p>News of the wreck at Smoky Creek reached
Medicine Bend from Point of Rocks at
five o&#8217;clock. Sinclair, in person, was overseeing
the making up of his wrecking train, and the yard,
usually quiet at that hour of the morning, was alive
with the hurry of men and engines. In the trainmaster&#8217;s
room of the weather-beaten headquarters
building, nicknamed by railroad men &#8220;The Wickiup,&#8221;
early comers&ndash;&ndash;sleepy-faced, keen-eyed trainmen&ndash;&ndash;lounged
on the tables and in chairs discussing
the reports from Point of Rocks, and among
them crew-callers and messengers moved in and
out. From the door of the big operators&#8217; room,
pushed at intervals abruptly open, burst a blaze of
light and the current crash of many keys; within,
behind glass screens, alert, smooth-faced boys in
shirt sleeves rained calls over the wires or bent with
flying pens above clips, taking incoming messages.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
At one end of the room, heedless of the strain
on the division, press despatches and cablegrams
clicked in monotonous relay over commercial wires;
while at the other, operators were taking from the
despatchers&#8217; room the train orders and the hurried
dispositions made for the wreck emergency by
Anderson, the assistant superintendent. At a table
in the alcove the chief operator was trying to reach
the division superintendent, McCloud, at Sleepy
Cat; at his elbow, his best man was ringing the
insistent calls of the despatcher and clearing the
line for Sinclair and the wrecking gang. Two minutes
after the wrecking train reported ready they
had their orders and were pulling out of the upper
yard, with right of way over everything to Point
of Rocks.</p>
<p>The wreck had occurred just west of the creek.
A fast east-bound freight train, double-headed, had
left the track on the long curve around the hill, and
when the wrecking train backed through Ten Shed
Cut the sun streamed over the heaps of jammed and
twisted cars strung all the way from the point of
the curve to the foot of Smoky Hill. The crew
of the train that lay in the ditch walked slowly
up the track to where the wreckers had pulled up,
and the freight conductor asked for Sinclair. Men
rigging the derrick pointed to the hind car. The
conductor, swinging up the caboose steps, made his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
way inside among the men that were passing out
tools. The air within was bluish-thick with tobacco
smoke, but through the haze the freightman saw
facing him, in the far corner of the den-like interior,
a man seated behind an old dining-car table, finishing
his breakfast; one glimpse was enough to identify
the dark beard of Sinclair, foreman of the
bridges and boss of the wrecking gang.</p>
<p>Beside him stood a steaming coffee-tank, and in
his right hand he held an enormous tin cup that he
was about to raise to his mouth when he saw the
freight conductor. With a laugh, Sinclair threw
up his left hand and beckoned him over. Then he
shook his hair just a little, tossed back his head,
opened an unusual mouth, drained the cup at a
gulp, and cursing the freightman fraternally, exclaimed,
&#8220;How many cars have you ditched this
time?&#8221;</p>
<p>The trainman, a sober-faced fellow, answered
dryly, &#8220;All I had.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Running too fast, eh?&#8221; glared Sinclair.</p>
<p>With the box cars piled forty feet high on the
track, the conductor was too old a hand to begin
a controversy. &#8220;Our time&#8217;s fast,&#8221; was all he
said.</p>
<p>Sinclair rose and exclaimed, &#8220;Come on!&#8221; And
the two, leaving the car, started up the track. The
wrecking boss paid no attention to his companion
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
as they forged ahead, but where the train had hit
the curve he scanned the track as he would a blue
print. &#8220;They&#8217;ll have your scalp for this,&#8221; he declared
abruptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon they will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stevens.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like all day for you, doesn&#8217;t it? No
matter; I guess I can help you out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Where the merchandise cars lay, below the
switch, the train crew knew that a tramp had been
caught. At intervals they heard groans under the
wreckage, which was piled high there. Sinclair
stopped at the derrick, and the freight conductor
went on to where his brakeman had enlisted two of
Sinclair&#8217;s giants to help get out the tramp. A
brake beam had crushed the man&#8217;s legs, and the
pallor of his face showed that he was hurt internally,
but he was conscious and moaned softly.
The men had started to carry him to the way car
when Sinclair came up, asked what they were doing,
and ordered them back to the wreck. They hastily
laid the tramp down. &#8220;But he wants water,&#8221; protested
a brakeman who was walking behind, carrying
his arm in a sling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Water!&#8221; bawled Sinclair. &#8220;Have my men
got nothing to do but carry a tramp to water? Get
ahead there and help unload those refrigerators.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
He&#8217;ll find water fast enough. Let the damned
hobo crawl down to the creek after it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tramp was too far gone for resentment;
he had fainted when they laid him down, and his
half-glazed eyes, staring at the sky, gave no evidence
that he heard anything.</p>
<p>The sun rose hot, for in the Red Desert sky there
is rarely a cloud. Sinclair took the little hill nearest
the switch to bellow his orders from, running
down among the men whenever necessary to help
carry them out. Within thirty minutes, though
apparently no impression had been made on the
great heaps of wrenched and splintered equipment,
Sinclair had the job in hand.</p>
<p>Work such as this was the man&#8217;s genius. In
handling a wreck Sinclair was a marvel among
mountain men. He was tall but not stout, with
flashing brown eyes and a strength always equal
to that of the best man in his crew. But his inspiration
lay in destruction, and the more complete
the better. There were no futile moves under
Sinclair&#8217;s quick eyes, no useless pulling and hauling,
no false grappling; but like a raven at a
feast, every time his derrick-beak plucked at the
wreck he brought something worth while away.
Whether he was righting a tender, rerailing an
engine, tearing out a car-body, or swinging a set
of trucks into the clear, Sinclair, men said, had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
luck, and no confusion in day or night was great
enough to drown his heavy tones or blur his rapid
thinking.</p>
<p>Just below where the wrecking boss stood lay
the tramp. The sun scorched his drawn face, but
he made no effort to turn from it. Sometimes he
opened his eyes, but Sinclair was not a promising
source of help, and no one that might have helped
dared venture within speaking distance of the injured
man. When the heat and the pain at last
extorted a groan and an appeal, Sinclair turned.
&#8220;Damn you, ain&#8217;t you dead yet? What?
Water?&#8221; He pointed to a butt standing in
the shade of a car that had been thrown out
near the switch. &#8220;There&#8217;s water; go get it!&#8221;
The cracking of a box car as the derrick wrenched
it from the wreck was engaging the attention of the
boss, and as he saw the grapple slip he yelled to
his men and pointed to the chains.</p>
<p>The tramp lay still a long time. At last he began
to drag himself toward the butt. In the glare
of the sun timbers strained and snapped, and men
with bars and axes chopped and wrenched at the
massive frames and twisted iron on the track. The
wrecking gang moved like ants in and out of the
shapeless d&eacute;bris, and at intervals, as the sun rose
higher, the tramp dragged himself nearer the butt.
He lay on the burning sand like a crippled insect,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
crawling, and waiting for strength to crawl. To
him there was no railroad and no wreck, but only
the blinding sun, the hot sand, the torture of thirst,
and somewhere water, if he could reach it.</p>
<p>The freight conductor, Stevens, afraid of no
man, had come up to speak to Sinclair, and Sinclair,
with a smile, laid a cordial hand on his shoulder.
&#8220;Stevens, it&#8217;s all right. I&#8217;ll get you out of
this. Come here.&#8221; He led the conductor down the
track where they had walked in the morning. He
pointed to flange-marks on the ties. &#8220;See there&ndash;&ndash;there&#8217;s
where the first wheels left the track, and
they left on the inside of the curve; a thin flange
under the first refrigerator broke. I&#8217;ve got the
wheel itself back there for evidence. They can&#8217;t
talk fast running against that. Damn a private
car-line, anyway! Give me a cigar&ndash;&ndash;haven&#8217;t got
any? Great guns, man, there&#8217;s a case of Key Wests
open up ahead; go fill your pockets and your grip.
Don&#8217;t be bashful; you&#8217;ve got friends on the division
if you are Irish, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, only I don&#8217;t smoke,&#8221; said Stevens, with
diplomacy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you drink, don&#8217;t you? There&#8217;s a barrel
of brandy open at the switch.&#8221;</p>
<p>The brandy-cask stood up-ended near the water-butt,
and the men dipped out of both with cups.
They were working now half naked at the wreck.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
The sun hung in a cloudless sky, the air was still,
and along the right of way huge wrecking fires
added to the scorching heat. Ten feet from the
water-butt lay a flattened mass of rags. Crusted
in smoke and blood and dirt, crushed by a vise of
beams and wheels out of human semblance, and left
now an aimless, twitching thing, the tramp clutched
at Stevens&#8217;s foot as he passed. &#8220;Water!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, old boy, how the devil did you get
here?&#8221; exclaimed Stevens, retreating in alarm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Water!&#8221;</p>
<p>Stevens stepped to the butt and filled a cup.
The tramp&#8217;s eyes were closed. Stevens poured the
water over his face; then he lifted the man&#8217;s head
and put a cupful to his lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that hobo alive yet?&#8221; asked Sinclair, coming
back smoking a cigar. &#8220;What does he want
now? Water? Don&#8217;t waste any time on him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s bad luck refusing water,&#8221; muttered Stevens,
holding the cup.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll be dead in a minute,&#8221; growled Sinclair.</p>
<p>The sound of his voice roused the failing man to
a fury. He opened his bloodshot eyes, and with the
dregs of an ebbing vitality cursed Sinclair with a
frenzy that made Stevens draw back. If Sinclair
was startled he gave no sign. &#8220;Go to hell!&#8221; he
exclaimed harshly.</p>
<p>With a ghastly effort the man made his retort.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
He held up his blood-soaked fingers. &#8220;I&#8217;m going
all right&ndash;&ndash;I know that,&#8221; he gasped, with a curse,
&#8220;but I&#8217;ll come back for you!&#8221;</p>
<p>Sinclair, unshaken, stood his ground. He repeated
his imprecation more violently; but Stevens,
swallowing, stole out of hearing. As he disappeared,
a train whistled in the west.

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>AT SMOKY CREEK</h3>
</div>
<p>Karg, Sinclair&#8217;s crew foreman, came running
over to him from a pile of merchandise that
had been set off the right of way on the wagon-road
for loot. &#8220;That&#8217;s the superintendent&#8217;s car coming,
ain&#8217;t it, Murray?&#8221; he cried, looking across the
creek at the approaching train.</p>
<p>&#8220;What of it?&#8221; returned Sinclair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, we&#8217;re just loading the team.&#8221;</p>
<p>The incoming train, an engine with a way car,
two flats, and the Bear Dance derrick, slowed up at
one end of the wreck while Sinclair and his foreman
talked. Three men could be seen getting out of
the way car&ndash;&ndash;McCloud and Reed Young, the
Scotch roadmaster, and Bill Dancing. A gang of
trackmen filed slowly out after them.</p>
<p>The leaders of the party made their way down
the curve, and Sinclair, with Karg, met them at the
point. McCloud asked questions about the wreck
and the chances of getting the track clear, and while
they talked Sinclair sent Karg to get the new derrick
into action. Sinclair then asked McCloud to walk
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
with him up the track to see where the cars had left
the rail. The two men showed in contrast as they
stepped along the ties. McCloud was not alone
younger and below Sinclair&#8217;s height: his broad
Stetson hat flattened him somewhat. His movement
was deliberate beside Sinclair&#8217;s litheness, and
his face, though burned by sun and wind, was boyish,
while Sinclair&#8217;s was strongly lined.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a moment,&#8221; suggested McCloud mildly,
as Sinclair hastened past the goods piled in the
wagon-road. &#8220;Whose team is that, Sinclair?&#8221;
The road followed the right of way where they
stood, and a four-horse team of heavy mules was
pulling a loaded ranch-wagon up the grade when
McCloud spoke.</p>
<p>Sinclair answered cordially. &#8220;That&#8217;s my team
from over on the Frenchman. I picked them up
at Denver. Nice mules, McCloud, ain&#8217;t they?
Give me mules every time for heavy work. If I
had just a hundred more of &#8217;em the company could
have my job&ndash;&ndash;what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. What&#8217;s that stuff they are hauling?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a little stuff mashed up in the merchandise
car; there&#8217;s some tobacco there and a little
wine, I guess. The cases are all smashed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s look at it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s nothing there that&#8217;s any good,
McCloud.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s look at it.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Bill Dancing and Young walked behind the
two men toward the wagon, Dancing made extraordinary
efforts to wink at the roadmaster. &#8220;That&#8217;s
a good story about the mules coming from Denver,
ain&#8217;t it?&#8221; he muttered. Young, unwilling to commit
himself, stopped to light his pipe. When he
and Dancing joined Sinclair and McCloud the talk
between the superintendent and the wrecking boss
had become animated.</p>
<p>&#8220;I always do something for my men out of a
wreck when I can; that&#8217;s the way I get the work
out of them,&#8221; Sinclair was saying. &#8220;A little stuff
like this,&#8221; he added, nodding toward the wagon,
&#8220;comes handy for presents, and the company
wouldn&#8217;t get any salvage out of it, anyway. I get
the value a dozen times over in quick work. Look
there!&#8221; Sinclair pointed to where the naked men
heaved and wrenched in the sun. &#8220;Where could
you get white men to work like that if you didn&#8217;t
jolly them along once in a while? What? You
haven&#8217;t been here long, McCloud,&#8221; smiled Sinclair,
laying a hand with heavy affection on the young
man&#8217;s shoulder. &#8220;Ask any man on the division
who gets the work out of his men&ndash;&ndash;who gets the
wrecks cleaned up and the track cleared. Ain&#8217;t
that what you want?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, Sinclair; no man that ever saw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
you handle a wreck would undertake to do it
better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what&#8217;s all this fuss about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been over all this matter before, as
you know. The claim department won&#8217;t stand for
this looting; that&#8217;s the whole story. Here are ten
or twelve cases of champagne on your wagon&ndash;&ndash;soiled
a little, but worth a lot of money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was a mistake loading that up; I admit
it; it was Karg&#8217;s carelessness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here is one whole case of cigars and part of
another,&#8221; continued McCloud, climbing from one
wheel to another of the wagon. &#8220;There is a
thousand dollars in this load! I know you&#8217;ve got
good men, Sinclair. If they are not getting paid
as they should be, give them time and a half or
double time, but put it in the pay checks. The
freight loss and damage account increased two
hundred per cent. last year. No railroad company
can keep that rate up and last, Sinclair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hang the company! The claim agents are a
pack of thieves,&#8221; cried Sinclair. &#8220;Look here, McCloud,
what&#8217;s a pay check to a man that&#8217;s sick, compared
with a bottle of good wine?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When one of your men is sick and needs wine,
let me know,&#8221; returned McCloud; &#8220;I&#8217;ll see that
he gets it. Your men don&#8217;t wear silk dresses, do
they?&#8221; he asked, pointing to another case of goods
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
under the driver&#8217;s seat. &#8220;Have that stuff all
hauled back and loaded into a box car on track.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not by a damned sight!&#8221; exclaimed Sinclair.
He turned to his ranch driver, Barney Rebstock.
&#8220;You haul that stuff where you were told to haul
it, Barney.&#8221; Then, &#8220;you and I may as well have
an understanding right here,&#8221; he said, as McCloud
walked to the head of the mules.</p>
<p>&#8220;By all means, and I&#8217;ll begin by countermanding
that order right now. Take your load straight
back to that car,&#8221; directed McCloud, pointing up
the track. Barney, a ranch hand with a cigarette
face looked surlily at McCloud.</p>
<p>Sinclair raised a finger at the boy. &#8220;You drive
straight ahead where I told you to drive. I don&#8217;t
propose to have my affairs interfered with by you
or anybody else, Mr. McCloud. You and I can
settle this thing ourselves,&#8221; he added, walking
straight toward the superintendent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get away from those mules!&#8221; yelled Barney
at the same moment, cracking his whip.</p>
<p>McCloud&#8217;s dull eyes hardly lightened as he
looked at the driver. &#8220;Don&#8217;t swing your whip
this way, my boy,&#8221; he said, laying hold quietly of
the near bridle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Drop that bridle!&#8221; roared Sinclair.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll drop your mules in their tracks if they
move one foot forward. Dancing, unhook those
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
traces,&#8221; said McCloud peremptorily. &#8220;Dump
the wine out of that wagon-box, Young.&#8221; Then
he turned to Sinclair and pointed to the wreck.
&#8220;Get back to your work.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sun marked the five men rooted for an instant
on the hillside. Dancing jumped at the
traces, Reed Young clambered over the wheel, and
Sinclair, livid, faced McCloud. With a bitter denunciation
of interlopers, claim agents, and
&#8220;fresh&#8221; railroad men generally, Sinclair swore he
would not go back to work, and a case of wine
crashing to the ground infuriated him. He turned
on his heel and started for the wreck. &#8220;Call off
the men!&#8221; he yelled to Karg at the derrick. The
foreman passed the word. The derrickmen, dropping
their hooks and chains in some surprise, moved
out of the wreckage. The axemen and laborers
gathered around the foreman and followed him
toward Sinclair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; cried Sinclair, &#8220;we&#8217;ve got a new superintendent,
a college guy. You know what they
are; the company has tried &#8217;em before. They
draw the salaries and we do the work. This one
down here now is making his little kick about the
few pickings we get out of our jobs. You can go
back to your work or you can stand right here with
me till we get our rights. What?&#8221;</p>
<p>Half a dozen men began talking at once. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
derrickman from below, a hatchet-faced wiper, with
the visor of a greasy cap cocked over his ear, stuck
his head between the uprights and called out shrilly,
&#8220;What&#8217;s er matter, Murray?&#8221; and a few men
laughed. Barney had deserted the mules. Dancing
and Young, with small regard for loss or damage,
were emptying the wagon like deckhands, for
in a fight such as now appeared imminent, possession
of the goods even on the ground seemed
vital to prestige. McCloud waited only long
enough to assure the emptying of the wagon,
and then followed Sinclair to where he had assembled
his men. &#8220;Sinclair, put your men back to
work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not till we know just how we stand,&#8221; Sinclair
answered insolently. He continued to speak, but
McCloud turned to the men. &#8220;Boys, go back to
your work. Your boss and I can settle our own
differences. I&#8217;ll see that you lose nothing by working
hard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;ll see we make nothing, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;
suggested Karg.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see that every man in the crew gets twice
what is coming to him&ndash;&ndash;all except you, Karg. I
discharge you now. Sinclair, will you go back to
work?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then take your time. Any men that want to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
go back to work may step over to the switch,&#8221;
added McCloud.</p>
<p>Not a man moved. Sinclair and Karg smiled
at each other, and with no apparent embarrassment
McCloud himself smiled. &#8220;I like to see men loyal
to their bosses,&#8221; he said good-naturedly. &#8220;I
wouldn&#8217;t give much for a man that wouldn&#8217;t stick
to his boss if he thought him right. But a question
has come up here, boys, that must be settled once
for all. This wreck-looting on the mountain division
is going to stop&ndash;&ndash;right here&ndash;&ndash;at this particular
wreck. On that point there is no room for
discussion. Now, any man that agrees with me on
that matter may step over here and I&#8217;ll discuss with
him any other grievance. If what I say about looting
is a grievance, it can&#8217;t be discussed. Is there
any man that wants to come over?&#8221; No man
stirred.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sinclair, you&#8217;ve got good men,&#8221; continued McCloud,
unmoved. &#8220;You are leading them into
pretty deep water. There&#8217;s a chance yet for you
to get them out of serious trouble if you think as
much of them as they do of you. Will you advise
them to go back to work&ndash;&ndash;all except Karg?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sinclair glared in high humor. &#8220;Oh, I couldn&#8217;t
do that! I&#8217;m discharged!&#8221; he protested, bowing
low.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be over-hasty,&#8221; returned McCloud.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
&#8220;This is a serious business, as you know
better than they do, and there will never be as good
a time to fix it up as now. There is a chance for
you, I say, Sinclair, to take hold if you want to
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I&#8217;ll take hold if you&#8217;ll take your nose
out of my business and agree to keep it out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there <i>any</i> man here that wants to go back
to work for the company?&#8221; continued McCloud
evenly. It was one man against thirty; McCloud
saw there was not the shadow of a chance to win
the strikers over. &#8220;This lets all of you out, you
understand, boys,&#8221; he added; &#8220;and you can never
work again for the company on this division if you
don&#8217;t take hold now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; exclaimed Sinclair, better-humored
every moment, &#8220;I&#8217;ll guarantee you work on this
division when all the fresh superintendents are run
out of the country, and I&#8217;ll lay this matter before
Bucks himself, and don&#8217;t you forget it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will have a chilly job of it,&#8221; interposed
McCloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;So will you, my hearty, before you get trains
running past here,&#8221; retorted the wrecking boss.
&#8220;Come on, boys.&#8221;</p>
<p>The disaffected men drew off. The emptied
wagon, its load scattered on the ground, stood deserted
on the hillside, and the mules drooped in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
heat. Bill Dancing, a giant and a dangerous one,
stood lone guard over the loot, and Young had
been called over by McCloud. &#8220;How many men
have you got with you, Reed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eleven.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How long will it take them to clean up this
mess with what help we can run in this afternoon?&#8221;</p>
<p>Young studied the prospect before replying.
&#8220;They&#8217;re green at this sort of thing, of course;
they might be fussing here till to-morrow noon, I&#8217;m
afraid; perhaps till to-morrow night, Mr. McCloud.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That won&#8217;t do!&#8221; The two men stood for a
moment in a study. &#8220;The merchandise is all
unloaded, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; said McCloud reflectively.
&#8220;Get your men here and bring a water-bucket with
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>McCloud walked down to the engine of the
wrecking train and gave orders to the train and engine
crews. The best of the refrigerator cars had
been rerailed, and they were pulled to a safe distance
from the wreck. Young brought the bucket,
and McCloud pointed to the caskful of brandy.
&#8220;Throw that brandy over the wreckage, Reed.&#8221;</p>
<p>The roadmaster started. &#8220;Burn the whole thing
up, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything on the track.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Bully! It&#8217;s a shame to waste the liquor, but it&#8217;s
Sinclair&#8217;s fault. Here, boys, scatter this stuff where
it will catch good, and touch her off. Everything
goes&ndash;&ndash;the whole pile. Burn up everything; that&#8217;s
orders. If you can get a few rails here, now, I&#8217;ll
give you a track by sundown, Mr. McCloud, in
spite of Sinclair and the devil.&#8221;</p>
<p>The remains of many cars lay in heaps along
the curve, and the trackmen like firebugs ran in
and out of them. A tongue of flame leaped from
the middle of a pile of stock cars. In five minutes
the wreck was burning; in ten minutes the flames
were crackling fiercely; then in another instant the
wreck burst into a conflagration that rose hissing
and seething a hundred feet straight up in the air.</p>
<p>From where they stood, Sinclair&#8217;s men looked on.
They were nonplussed, but their boss had not
lost his nerve. He walked back to McCloud.
&#8220;You&#8217;re going to send us back to Medicine Bend
with the car, I suppose?&#8221;</p>
<p>McCloud spoke amiably. &#8220;Not on your life.
Take your personal stuff out of the car and tell
your men to take theirs; then get off the train and
off the right of way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Going to turn us loose on Red Desert, are
you?&#8221; asked Sinclair steadily.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve turned yourselves loose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t give a man a tie-pass, would you?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Come to my office in Medicine Bend and I&#8217;ll
talk to you about it,&#8221; returned McCloud impassively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, boys,&#8221; roared Sinclair, going back to his
followers, &#8220;we can&#8217;t ride on this road now! But
I want to tell you there&#8217;s something to eat for
every one of you over at my place on the Crawling
Stone, and a place to sleep&ndash;&ndash;and something to
drink,&#8221; he added, cursing McCloud once more.</p>
<p>The superintendent eyed him, but made no response.
Sinclair led his men to the wagon, and
they piled into it till the box was filled. Barney
Rebstock had the reins again, and the mules
groaned as the whip cracked. Those that could
not climb into the wagon as it moved off straggled
along behind, and the air was filled with cheers and
curses.</p>
<p>The wreck burned furiously, and the column
of black smoke shot straight up. Sinclair, as his
cavalcade moved over the hill, followed on foot,
grimly. He was the last to cross the divide that
shut the scene on the track away from the striking
wreckers, and as he reached the crest he paused
and looked back, standing for a moment like a
statue outlined in the vivid sunshine. For all his
bravado, something told him he should never
handle another wreck on the mountain division&ndash;&ndash;that
he stood a king dethroned. Uninviting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
enough to many men, this had been his kingdom,
and he loved the power it gave him. He had run
it like many a reckless potentate, but no one could
say he had not been royal in his work as well as in
his looting. It was impossible not to admire the
man, his tremendous capacity, his extraordinary
power as a leader; and no one liked his better
traits more than McCloud himself. But Sinclair
never loved McCloud. Long afterward he told
Whispering Smith that he made his first mistake in
a long and desperate game in not killing McCloud
when he laid his hand that morning on the bridle
of the mules; it would have been easy then. Sinclair
might have been thinking of it even as he
stood looking back. But he stood only for a moment,
then turned and passed over the hill.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>DICKSIE</h3>
</div>
<p>The wreckers, drifting in the blaze of the
sun across the broad alkali valley, saw the
smoke of the wreck-fire behind them. No breath
of wind stirred it. With the stillness of a signal
column it rose, thin and black, and high in the air
spread motionless, like a huge umbrella, above
Smoky Creek. Reed Young had gone with an engine
to wire re&euml;nforcements, and McCloud, active
among the trackmen until the conflagration spent
itself, had retired to the shade of the hill.</p>
<p>Reclining against a rock with his legs crossed,
he had clasped his hands behind his head and sat
looking at the iron writhing in the dying heat of
the fire. The sound of hoofs aroused him, and
looking below he saw a horsewoman reining up
near his men at the wreck. She rode an American
horse, thin and rangy, and the experienced way
in which she checked him drew him back almost
to his haunches. But McCloud&#8217;s eyes were fixed
on the slender figure of the rider. He was wholly
at a loss to account, at such a time and in such a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
place, for a visitor in gauntleted gloves and a
banded Panama hat. He studied her with growing
amazement. Her hair coiled low on her neck
supported the very free roll of the hat-brim. Her
black riding-skirt clung to her waist to form its
own girdle, and her white stock, rolled high on her
neck, rose above a heavy shirtwaist of white linen,
and gave her an air of confident erectness. The
trackmen stopped work to look, but her attitude
in their gaze was one of impatience rather than of
embarrassment. Her boot flashed in the stirrup
while she spoke to the nearest man, and her horse
stretched his neck and nosed the brown alkali-grass
that spread thinly along the road.</p>
<p>To McCloud she was something like an apparition.
He sat spellbound until the trackman
indiscreetly pointed him out, and the eyes of the
visitor, turning his way, caught him with his hands
on the rock in an attitude openly curious. She
turned immediately away, but McCloud rose and
started down the hill. The horse&#8217;s head was pulled
up, and there were signs of departure. He quickened
his steps. Once he saw, or thought he saw,
the rider&#8217;s head so turned that her eyes might have
commanded one approaching from his quarter;
yet he could catch no further glimpse of her face.
A second surprise awaited him. Just as she seemed
about to ride away, she dropped lightly from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
horse to the ground, and he saw how confident in
figure she was. As she began to try her saddle-girths,
McCloud attempted a greeting. She could
not ignore his hat, held rather high above his head
as he approached, but she gave him the slightest
nod in return&ndash;&ndash;one that made no attempt to explain
why she was there or where she had come from.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardon me,&#8221; ventured McCloud, &#8220;have you
lost your way?&#8221;</p>
<p>He was immediately conscious that he had said
the wrong thing. The expression of her eyes implied
that it was foolish to suppose she was lost
but she only answered, &#8220;I saw the smoke and
feared the bridge was on fire.&#8221;</p>
<p>Something in her voice made him almost sorry
he had intervened; if she stood in need of help of
any sort it was not apparent, and her gaze was confusing.
He became conscious that he was at the
worst for an inspection; his face felt streaky with
smoke, his hat and shirt had suffered severely
in directing the fire, and his hands were black. He
said to himself in revenge that she was not pretty,
despite the fact that she seemed completely to take
away his consequence. He felt, while she inspected
him, like a brakeman.</p>
<p>&#8220;I presume Mr. Sinclair is here?&#8221; she said
presently.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry to say he is not.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></div>
<p>&#8220;He usually has charge of the wrecks, I think.
What a dreadful fire!&#8221; she murmured, looking
down the track. She stood beside the horse with
one hand resting on her girdle. Around the hand
that held the bridle her quirt lay coiled in the
folds of her glove, and, though seemingly undecided
as to what to do, her composure did not
lessen. As she looked at the wreckage, a breath of
wind lifted the hair that curled around her ear.
The mountain wind playing on her neck had left it
brown, and above, the pulse of her ride rose red
in her cheek. &#8220;Was it a passenger wreck?&#8221; She
turned abruptly on McCloud to ask the question.
Her eyes were brown, too, he saw, and a doubt
assailed him. Was she pretty?</p>
<p>&#8220;Only a freight wreck,&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought if there were passengers hurt I
could send help from the ranch. Were you the
conductor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fortunately not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And no one was hurt?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only a tramp. We are burning the wreck to
clear the track.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From the divide it looked like a mountain on
fire. I&#8217;m sorry Mr. Sinclair is not here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, indeed, yes, so am I.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I know him. You are one of his men,
I presume.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Not exactly; but is there anything I can
do&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, thank you, nothing, except that you might
tell him the pretty bay colt he sent over to us has
sprung his shoulder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He will be sorry to hear it, I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But we are doing everything possible for him.
He is going to make a perfectly lovely horse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And whom may I say the message is from?&#8221;
Though disconcerted, McCloud was regaining his
wits. He felt perfectly certain there was no danger,
if she knew Sinclair and lived in the mountains,
but that she would sometime find out he was
not a conductor. When he asked his question
she appeared slightly surprised and answered
easily, &#8220;Mr. Sinclair will know it is from Dicksie
Dunning.&#8221;</p>
<p>McCloud knew her then. Every one knew Dicksie
Dunning in the high country. This was Dicksie
Dunning of the great Crawling Stone ranch, most
widely known of all the mountain ranches. While
his stupidity in not guessing her identity before
overwhelmed him, he resolved to exhaust the last
effort to win her interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know just when I shall see Mr. Sinclair,&#8221;
he answered gravely, &#8220;but he shall certainly
have your message.&#8221;</p>
<p>A doubt seemed to steal over Dicksie at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
change in McCloud&#8217;s manner. &#8220;Oh, pardon me&ndash;&ndash;I
thought you were working for the company.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are quite right, I am; but Mr. Sinclair is
not.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyebrows rose a little. &#8220;I think you are
mistaken, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is possible I am; but if he is working for the
company, it is pretty certain that I am not,&#8221; he continued,
heaping mystification on her. &#8220;However,
that will not prevent my delivering the message.
By the way, may I ask which shoulder?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shoulder!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which shoulder is sprung.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, of course! The right shoulder, and it is
sprung pretty badly, too, Cousin Lance says. How
very stupid of me to ride over here for a freight
wreck!&#8221;</p>
<p>McCloud felt humiliated at having nothing better
worth while to offer. &#8220;It was a very bad one,&#8221;
he ventured.</p>
<p>&#8220;But not of the kind I can be of any help at, I
fear.&#8221;</p>
<p>McCloud smiled. &#8220;We are certainly short of
help.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dicksie brought her horse&#8217;s head around. She
felt again of the girth as she replied, &#8220;Not such
as I can supply, I&#8217;m afraid.&#8221; And with the words
she stepped away, as if preparing to mount.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></div>
<p>McCloud intervened. &#8220;I hope you won&#8217;t go
away without resting your horse. The sun is so
hot. Mayn&#8217;t I offer you some sort of refreshment?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dicksie Dunning thought not.</p>
<p>&#8220;The sun is very warm,&#8221; persisted McCloud.</p>
<p>Dicksie smoothed her gauntlet in the assured
manner natural to her. &#8220;I am pretty well used
to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>But McCloud held on. &#8220;Several cars of fruit
were destroyed in the wreck. I can offer you any
quantity of grapes&ndash;&ndash;crates of them are spoiling
over there&ndash;&ndash;and pears.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, I am just from luncheon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I have cooled water in the car. I hope
you won&#8217;t refuse that, so far out in the desert.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dicksie laughed a little. &#8220;Do you call this
far? I don&#8217;t; and I don&#8217;t call this desert by any
means. Thank you ever so much for the water,
but I&#8217;m not in the least thirsty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was kind of you even to think of extending
help. I wish you would let me send some fruit
over to your ranch. It is only spoiling here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dicksie stroked the neck of her horse. &#8220;It is
about eighteen miles to the ranch house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t call that far.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it isn&#8217;t,&#8221; she returned hastily, professing
not to notice the look that went with the words,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
&#8220;except for perishable things!&#8221; Then, as if acknowledging
her disadvantage, she added, swinging
her bridle-rein around, &#8220;I am under obligations
for the offer, just the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At least, won&#8217;t you let your horse drink?&#8221;
McCloud threw the force of an appeal into his
words, and Dicksie stopped her preparations and
appeared to waver.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim is pretty thirsty, I suppose. Have you
plenty of water?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A tender full. Had I better lead him down
while you wait up on the hill in the shade?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t I ride him down?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be pretty rough riding.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jim goes anywhere,&#8221; she said, with her
attractive indifference to situations. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t
mind helping me mount.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With pleasure.&#8221;</p>
<p>She stood waiting for his hand, and McCloud
stood, not knowing just what to do. She glanced
at him expectantly. The sun grew intensely hot.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will have to show me how,&#8221; he stammered
at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>He mentally cursed the technical education that
left him helpless at such a moment, but it was useless
to pretend. &#8220;Frankly, I don&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just give me your hand. Oh, not in that way!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
But never mind, I&#8217;ll walk,&#8221; she suggested, catching
up her skirt.</p>
<p>&#8220;The rocks will cut your boots all to pieces.
Suppose you tell me what to do this once,&#8221; he said,
assuming some confidence. &#8220;I&#8217;ll never forget.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, if you will just give me your hand for
my foot, I can manage, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>He did not know, but she lifted her skirt graciously,
and her crushed boot rested easily for a
moment in his hand. She rose in the air above
him before he could well comprehend. He felt
the quick spring from his supporting hand, and it
was an instant of exhilaration. Then she balanced
herself with a flushed laugh in the saddle, and he
guided her ahead among the loose rocks, the horse
nosing at his elbow as they picked their way.</p>
<p>Crossing the track, they gained better ground.
As they reached the switch and passed a box car,
Jim shied, and Dicksie spoke sharply to him. McCloud
turned.</p>
<p>In the shade of the car lay the tramp.</p>
<p>&#8220;That man lying there frightened him,&#8221; explained
Dicksie. &#8220;Oh,&#8221; she exclaimed suddenly,
&#8220;he has been hurt!&#8221; She turned away her head.
&#8220;Is that the man who was in the wreck?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do something for him. He must be suffering
terribly.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span></div>
<p>&#8220;The men gave him some water awhile ago,
and when we moved him into the shade we thought
he was dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He isn&#8217;t dead yet!&#8221; Dicksie&#8217;s face, still
averted, had grown white. &#8220;I saw him move.
Can&#8217;t you do something for him?&#8221;</p>
<p>She reined up at a little distance. McCloud
bent over the man a moment and spoke to him.
When he rose he called to the men on the track.
&#8220;You are right,&#8221; he said, rejoining Dicksie; &#8220;he
is very much alive. His name is Wickwire; he is
a cowboy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A cowboy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A tramp cowboy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What can you do with him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have the men put him in the caboose and
send him to Barnhardt&#8217;s hospital at Medicine
Bend when the engine comes back. He may live
yet. If he does, he can thank you for it.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>GEORGE McCLOUD</h3>
</div>
<p>McCloud was an exception to every tradition
that goes to make up a mountain
railroad man. He was from New England, with
a mild voice and a hand that roughened very
slowly. McCloud was a classmate of Morris
Blood&#8217;s at the Boston &#8220;Tech,&#8221; and the acquaintance
begun there continued after the two left
school, with a scattering fire of letters between the
mountains and New England, as few and as far
between as men&#8217;s letters usually scatter after an
ardent school acquaintance.</p>
<p>There were just two boys in the McCloud family&ndash;&ndash;John
and George. One had always been intended
for the church, the other for science. Somehow
the boys got mixed in their cradles, or, what
is the same matter, in their assignments, and John
got into the church. For George, who ought to
have been a clergyman, nothing was left but a long
engineering course for which, after he got it, he
appeared to have no use. However, it seemed a
little late to shift the life alignments. John had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
the pulpit and appeared disposed to keep it, and
George was left, like a New England farm, to
wonder what had become of himself.</p>
<p>It is, nevertheless, odd how matters come about.
John McCloud, a prosperous young clergyman,
stopped on a California trip at Medicine Bend to
see brother George&#8217;s classmate and something of
a real Western town. He saw nothing sensational&ndash;&ndash;it
was there, but he did not see it&ndash;&ndash;but he found
both hospitality and gentlemen, and, if surprised,
was too well-bred to admit it. His one-day stop
ran on to several days. He was a guest at the
Medicine Bend Club, where he found men who
had not forgotten the Harvard Greek plays. He
rode in private cars and ate antelope steak grilled
by Glover&#8217;s own darky boy, who had roasted buffalo
hump for the Grand Duke Alexis as far back
as 1871, and still hashed his browned potatoes in
ragtime; and with the sun breaking clear over the
frosty table-lands, a ravenous appetite, and a day&#8217;s
shooting in prospect, the rhythm had a particularly
cheerful sound. John was asked to occupy a Medicine
Bend pulpit, and before Sunday the fame of
his laugh and his marksmanship had spread so far
that Henry Markover, the Yale cowboy, rode in
thirty-two miles to hear him preach. In leaving,
John McCloud, in a seventh heaven of enthusiasm
over the high country, asked Morris Blood
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
why he could not find something for George out
there; and Blood, not even knowing the boy wanted
to come, wrote for him, and asked Bucks to give
him a job. Possibly, being over-solicitous, George
was nervous when he talked to Bucks; possibly the
impression left by his big, strong, bluff brother
John made against the boy; at all events, Bucks,
after he talked with George, shook his head.
&#8220;I could make a first-class railroad man out of the
preacher, Morris, but not out of the brother. Yes,
I&#8217;ve talked with him. He can&#8217;t do anything but
figure elevations, and, by heaven, we can&#8217;t feed our
own engineers here now.&#8221; So George found himself
stranded in the mountains.</p>
<p>Morris Blood was cut up over it, but George
McCloud took it quietly. &#8220;I&#8217;m no worse off here
than I was back there, Morris.&#8221; Blood, at that,
plucked up courage to ask George to take a job in
the Cold Springs mines, and George jumped at it.
It was impossible to get a white man to live at Cold
Springs after he could save money enough to get
away, so George was welcomed as assistant superintendent
at the Number Eight Mine, with no
salary to speak of and all the work.</p>
<p>In one year everybody had forgotten him.
Western men, on the average, show a higher heart
temperature than Eastern men, but they are tolerably
busy people and have their own troubles.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
&#8220;Be patient,&#8221; Morris Blood had said to him.
&#8220;Sometime there will be more railroad work in
these mountains; then, perhaps, your darned engineering
may come into play. I wish you knew
how to sell cigars.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meantime, McCloud stuck to the mine, and insensibly
replaced his Eastern tissue with Western.
In New England he had been carefully moulded
by several generations of gentlemen, but never
baked hard. The mountains put the crust on him.
For one thing, the sun and wind, best of all hemlocks,
tanned his white skin into a tough all-American
leather, seasoned his muscles into rawhide
sinews, and, without burdening him with
an extra ounce of flesh, sprinkled the red through
his blood till, though thin, he looked apoplectic.</p>
<p>Insensibly, too, something else came about.
George McCloud developed the rarest of all gifts
of temperament, even among men of action&ndash;&ndash;the
ability to handle men. In Cold Springs, indeed, it
was a case either of handling or of being handled.
McCloud got along with his men and, with the
tough element among them, usually through persuasion;
but he proved, too, that he could inspire
confidence even with a club.</p>
<p>One day, coming down &#8220;special&#8221; from Bear
Dance, Gordon Smith, who bore the nickname
Whispering Smith, rode with President Bucks in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
the privacy of his car. The day had been long, and
the alkali lay light on the desert. The business in
hand had been canvassed, and the troubles put aside
for chicken, coffee, and cigars, when Smith, who did
not smoke, told the story of something he had seen
the day before at Cold Springs that pleased him.</p>
<p>The men in the Number Eight Mine had determined
to get rid of some Italians, and after a good
deal of rowing had started in to catch one of them
and hang him. They had chosen a time when McCloud,
the assistant superintendent of the mine,
was down with mountain fever. It was he who
had put the Italians into the mine. He had already
defended them from injury, and would be likely,
it was known, to do so again if he were able. On
this day a mob had been chasing the Dagos, and
had at length captured one. They were running
him down street to a telegraph pole when the assistant
superintendent appeared in scant attire and
stopped them. Taking advantage of the momentary
confusion, he hustled their victim into the only
place of refuge at hand, a billiard hall. The mob
rushed the hall. In the farthest corner the unlucky
Italian, bleeding like a bullock and insane
with fright, knelt, clinging to McCloud&#8217;s
shaky knees. In trying to make the back door the
two had been cut off, and the sick boss had got
into a corner behind a pool-table to make his stand.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
In his pocket he had a pistol, knowing that to use
it meant death to him as well as to the wretch he
was trying to save. Fifty men were yelling in the
room. They had rope, hatchets, a sprinkling of
guns, and whiskey enough to burn the town, and in
the corner behind a pool-table stood the mining
boss with mountain fever, the Dago, and a broken
billiard-cue.</p>
<p>Bucks took the cigar from his mouth, leaned
forward in his chair, and stretched his heavy chin
out of his neck as if the situation now promised a
story. The leader, Smith continued, was the mine
blacksmith, a strapping Welshman, from whom
McCloud had taken the Italian in the street.
The blacksmith had a revolver, and was crazy with
liquor. McCloud singled him out in the crowd,
pointed a finger at him, got the attention of the
men, and lashed him across the table with his
tongue until the blacksmith opened fire on him with
his revolver, McCloud all the while shaking his
finger at him and abusing him like a pickpocket.
&#8220;The crowd couldn&#8217;t believe its eyes,&#8221; Gordon
Smith concluded, &#8220;and McCloud was pushing for
the blacksmith with his cue when Kennedy and I
squirmed through to the front and relieved the tension.
McCloud wasn&#8217;t hit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is that mining man&#8217;s name?&#8221; asked
Bucks, reaching for a message clip.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span></div>
<p>&#8220;McCloud.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;First name?&#8221; continued Bucks mechanically.</p>
<p>&#8220;George.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bucks looked at his companion in surprise.
Then he spoke, and a feeling of self-abasement
was reflected in his words. &#8220;George McCloud,&#8221;
he echoed. &#8220;Did you say George? Why, I must
know that man. I turned him down once for a
job. He looked so peaceable I thought he was
too soft for us.&#8221; The president laid down his cigar
with a gesture of disgust. &#8220;And yet there really
are people along this line that think I&#8217;m clever. I
haven&#8217;t judgment enough to operate a trolley car.
It&#8217;s a shame to take the money they give me for
running this system, Gordon. Hanged if I didn&#8217;t
think that fellow was too soft.&#8221; He called the
flagman over. &#8220;Tell Whitmyer we will stay at
Cold Springs to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you were going through to Medicine
Bend,&#8221; suggested Smith as the trainman disappeared.</p>
<p>&#8220;McCloud,&#8221; repeated Bucks, taking up his
cigar and throwing back his head in a cloud of
smoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; assented his companion; &#8220;but I am
going through to Medicine Bend, Mr. Bucks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How am I to do it?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Take the car and send it back to-morrow on
Number Three.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, if you won&#8217;t need it to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t. I am going to stay at Cold Springs
to-night and hunt up McCloud.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But that man is in bed in a very bad way; you
can&#8217;t see him. He is going to die.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he isn&#8217;t. I am going to hunt him up and
have him taken care of.&#8221;</p>
<p>That night Bucks, in the twilight, was sitting by
McCloud&#8217;s bed, smoking and looking him over.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t mind me,&#8221; he said when he entered the
room, lifted the ill-smelling lamp from the table,
and, without taking time to blow it out, pitched
it through the open window. &#8220;I heard you were
sick, and just looked in to see how they were taking
care of you. Wilcox,&#8221; he added, turning to the
nurse he had brought in&ndash;&ndash;a barber who wanted to
be a railroad man, and had agreed to step into the
breach and nurse McCloud&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;have a box of
miner&#8217;s candles sent up from the roundhouse. We
have some down there; if not, buy a box and send
me the bill.&#8221;</p>
<p>McCloud, who after the rioting had crawled
back to bed with a temperature of 105 degrees,
knew the barber, but felt sure that a lunatic had
wandered in with him, and immediately bent his
feeble mental energies on plans for getting rid of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
a dangerous man. When Bucks sat down by him
and continued talking at the nurse, McCloud caught
nothing of what was said until Bucks turned quietly
toward him. &#8220;They tell me, McCloud, you have
the fever.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sick man, staring with sunken eyes, rose
half on his elbow in astonishment to look again
at his visitor, but Bucks eased him back with
an admonition to guard his strength. McCloud&#8217;s
temperature had already risen with the excitement
of seeing a man throw his lamp out of the window.
Bucks, meantime, working carefully to
seem unconcerned and incensing McCloud with
great clouds of smoke, tried to discuss his case
with him as he had already done with the mine
surgeon. McCloud, thinking it best to humor
a crazy man, responded quietly. &#8220;The doctor
said yesterday,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;it was mountain
fever, and he wants to put me into an ice-pack.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bucks objected vigorously to the ice-pack.</p>
<p>&#8220;The doctor tells me that it is the latest treatment
for that class of fevers in the Prussian army,&#8221;
answered McCloud feebly, but getting interested
in spite of himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good thing, no doubt, for the Prussian
army,&#8221; replied Bucks, &#8220;but, McCloud, in the
first place, you are not a Dutchman; in the second,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
you have not got mountain fever&ndash;&ndash;not in my judgment.&#8221;</p>
<p>McCloud, confident now that he had an insane
man on his hands, held his peace.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a symptom of mountain fever,&#8221; continued
Bucks calmly; &#8220;you have what looks to me like
gastritis, but the homeopaths,&#8221; he added, &#8220;have
a better name for it. Is it stomatitis, McCloud?
I forget.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sick man, confounded by such learning, determined
to try one question, and, if he was at
fault, to drag his gun from under his pillow and
sell his life as dearly as possible. Summoning his
waning strength, he looked hard at Bucks. &#8220;Just
let me ask you one question. I never saw you before.
Are you a doctor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m a railroad man; my name is Bucks.&#8221;
McCloud rose half up in bed with amazement.
&#8220;They&#8217;ll kill you if you lie here a week,&#8221; continued
Bucks. &#8220;In just a week. Now I&#8217;ll tell you
my plan. I&#8217;ll take you down in the morning in my
car to Medicine Bend; this barber will go with
us. There in the hospital you can get everything
you need, and I can make you comfortable. What
do you say?&#8221;</p>
<p>McCloud looked at his benefactor solemnly, but
if hope flickered for an instant in his eyes it soon
died. Bucks said afterward that he looked like a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
cold-storage squab, just pinfeathers and legs.
&#8220;Shave him clean,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and you could have
counted his teeth through his cheeks.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sick man turned his face to the wall.
&#8220;It&#8217;s kind enough,&#8221; he muttered, &#8220;but I guess it&#8217;s
too late.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bucks did not speak for some time. Twilight
had faded above the hills, and only the candle
lighted the room. Then the master of mountain
men, grizzled and brown, turned his eyes again to
the bed. McCloud was staring at the ceiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a town of your name down on the
plains, McCloud,&#8221; said Bucks, blowing away the
cigar smoke after the long silence. &#8220;It is one of
our division points, and a good one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know the town,&#8221; responded McCloud. &#8220;It
was named after one of our family.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was, though,&#8221; said McCloud wearily.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; returned Bucks, &#8220;you must be mistaken.
The man that town was named after belonged
to the fighting McClouds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is my family.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then where is your fight? When I propose to
put you into my car and pull you out of this, why
do you say it is too late? It is never too late.&#8221;</p>
<p>McCloud made no answer, and Bucks ran on:
&#8220;For a man that worked out as well as you did
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
yesterday in a trial heat with a billiard-cue, I should
say you could turn a handspring or two yet if you
had to. For that matter, if you don&#8217;t want to be
moved, I can run a spur in here to your door in
three hours in the morning. By taking out the
side-wall we can back the car right up to the bed.
Why not? Or we can stick a few hydraulic jacks
under the sills, raise the house, and push your bed
right on the observation platform.&#8221; He got McCloud
to laughing, and lighted a fresh cigar. A
framed photograph hung on one of the bare walls
of the room, and it caught the eye of the railroad
man. He walked close to it, disinfected it with
smoke, brushed the dust from the glass, and examined
the print. &#8220;That looks like old Van Dyne
College campus, hanged if it doesn&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>McCloud was watching him. &#8220;It is a photograph
of the campus.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;McCloud, are you a Van Dyne man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did my college work there before I went to
Boston.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bucks stood motionless. &#8220;Poor little old Van
Dyne! Why, my brother Sam taught at Van
Dyne. No, you would not have known him; he&#8217;s
dead. Never before west of the Missouri River
have I seen a Van Dyne man. You are the first.&#8221;
He shook his head as he sat down again. &#8220;It is
crowded out now: no money, no prestige, half-starved
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
professors with their elbows out, the president
working like a dog all the week and preaching
somewhere every Sunday to earn five dollars.
But, by Heaven, they turned out men! Did you
know Bug Robinson?&#8221; he asked suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;He gave me my degree.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Old Bug! He was Sam&#8217;s closest friend, McCloud.
It&#8217;s good to see him getting the recognition
he deserves, isn&#8217;t it? Do you know, I send
him an annual every year? Yes, sir! And one year
I had the whole blooming faculty out here on a fossil
expedition; but, by Heaven, McCloud, some of
them looked more like megatheriums than what
they dug up did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard about that expedition.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never got to college. I had to hustle. I&#8217;ll
get out of here before I tire you. Wilcox will be
here all night, and my China boy is making some
broth for you now. You&#8217;ll feel better in the
morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ten weeks later McCloud was sent from Medicine
Bend up on the Short Line as trainmaster, and
on the Short Line he learned railroading.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s how I came here,&#8221; said George McCloud
to Farrell Kennedy a long time afterward,
at Medicine Bend. &#8220;I had shrivelled and starved
three years out there in the desert. I lived with
those cattle underground till I had forgotten my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
own people, my own name, my own face&ndash;&ndash;and
Bucks came along one day with Whispering Smith
and dragged me out of my coffin. They had it ordered,
and it being a small size and &#8216;onhandy,&#8217; as
the undertaker said, I paid for it and told him to
store it for me. Well, do you think I ever could
forget either of those men, Farrell?&#8221;</p>
<p>McCloud&#8217;s fortunes thus threw him first into the
operating department of the mountain lines, but
his heart was in the grades and the curves. To him
the interest in the trainwork was the work of the
locomotives toiling with the heavy loads up the
canyons and across the uneven plateaus and through
the deep gorges of the inner range, where the panting
exhaust, choked between sheer granite walls,
roared in a mighty protest against the burden put
by the steep grades on the patient machines.</p>
<p>In all the group of young men then on the mountain
division, obscure and unknown at the time, but
destined within so few years to be scattered far and
wide as constructionists with records made in the
rebuilding operations through the Rocky Mountains,
none was less likely to attract attention than
McCloud. Bucks, who, indeed, could hardly be
reckoned so much of the company as its head, was
a man of commanding proportions physically.
Like Glover, Bucks was a giant in stature, and
the two men, when together, could nowhere escape
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
notice; they looked, in a word, their part, fitted
to cope with the tremendous undertakings that had
fallen to their lot. Callahan, the chess-player on
the Overland lines, the man who could hold large
combinations of traffic movement constantly in his
head and by intuition reach the result of a given
problem before other men could work it out, was,
like Morris Blood, the master of tonnage, of middle
age. But McCloud, when he went to the mountain
division, in youthfulness of features was boyish,
and when he left he was still a boy, bronzed,
but young of face in spite of a lifetime&#8217;s pressure
and worry crowded into three years. He himself
counted this physical make-up as a disadvantage.
&#8220;It has embroiled me in no end of trouble, because
I couldn&#8217;t convince men I was in earnest until I
made good in some hard way,&#8221; he complained once
to Whispering Smith. &#8220;I never could acquire even
a successful habit of swearing, so I had to learn to
fight.&#8221;</p>
<p>When, one day in Boney Street in Medicine
Bend, he threw open the door of Marion Sinclair&#8217;s
shop, flung his hat sailing along the showcase with
his war-cry, and called to her in the back rooms,
she thought he had merely run in to say he was in
town.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you do? What do you think?
You&#8217;re going to have an old boarder back,&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
cried. &#8220;I&#8217;m coming to Medicine Bend, superintendent
of the division!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. McCloud!&#8221; Marion Sinclair clasped
her hands and dropped into a chair. &#8220;Have they
made you superintendent already?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I like that! Do you want them to wait
till I&#8217;m gray-headed?&#8221;</p>
<p>Marion threw her hands to her own head.
&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t say anything about gray hairs. My
head won&#8217;t bear inspection. But I can&#8217;t get over
this promotion coming so soon&ndash;&ndash;this whole big
division! Well, I congratulate you very sincerely&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but that isn&#8217;t it! I suppose anybody will
congratulate me. But where am I to board? Have
you a cook? You know how I went from bad to
worse after you left Cold Springs. May I have my
meals here with you as I used to there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I suppose you can, yes, if you can stand
the cooking. I have an apprentice, Mr. Dancing&#8217;s
daughter, who does pretty well. She lives here
with me, and is learning the business. But I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t
take as much as you used to pay me, for I&#8217;m doing
so much better down here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me run that end of it, will you? I shall
be doing better down here myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>They laughed as they bantered. Marion Sinclair
wore gold spectacles, but they did not hide the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
delightful good-nature in her eyes. On the third
finger of her slender left hand she wore, too, a gold
band that explained the gray in her hair at twenty-six.</p>
<p>This was the wife of Murray Sinclair, whom he
had brought to the mountains from her far-away
Wisconsin home. Within a year he had broken her
heart so far as it lay in him to do it, but he could
not break her charm nor her spirit. She was too
proud to go back, when forced to leave him, and
had set about earning her own living in the country
to which she had come as a bride. She put on spectacles,
she mutilated her heavy brown hair and
to escape notice and secure the obscurity that she
craved, her name, Marion, became, over the door
of her millinery shop and in her business, only
&#8220;M. Sinclair.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cold Springs, where Sinclair had first brought
her when he had headquarters there as foreman of
bridges, had proved a hopeless place for the millinery
business&ndash;&ndash;at least, in the way that Marion ran
it. The women that had husbands had no money to
buy hats with, and the women without husbands
wore gaudy headgear, and were of the kind that
made Marion&#8217;s heart creep when they opened the
shop door. What was worse, they were inclined to
joke with her, as if there must be a community of
interest between a deserted woman and women who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
had deserted womanhood. To this business Marion
would not cater, and in consequence her millinery
affairs sometimes approached collapse. She
could, however, cook extraordinarily well, and, with
the aid of a servant-maid, could always provide for
a boarder or two&ndash;&ndash;perhaps a railroad man or a
mine superintendent to whom she could serve meals,
and who, like all mountain men, were more than
generous in their accounting with women. Among
these standbys of hers was McCloud. McCloud
had always been her friend, and when she left Cold
Springs and moved to Medicine Bend to set up her
little shop in Boney Street near Fort, she had lost
him. Yet somehow, to compensate Marion for
other cruel things in the mountains, Providence
seemed to raise up a new friend for her wherever
she went. In Medicine Bend she did not know a
soul, but almost the first customer that walked into
her shop&ndash;&ndash;and she was a customer worth while&ndash;&ndash;was
Dicksie Dunning of the Crawling Stone.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>THE CRAWLING STONE</h3>
</div>
<p>Where the mountain chains of North
America have been flung up into a continental
divide, the country in many of its aspects
is still terrible. In extent alone this mountain empire
is grandiose. The swiftest transcontinental
trains approaching its boundaries at night find night
falling again before they have fairly penetrated it.
Geologically severe, this region in geological store
is the richest of the continent; physically forbidding
beyond all other stretches of North America,
the Barren Land alone excepted, in this region lie
its gentlest valleys. Here the desert is most grotesque,
and here are pastoral retreats the most
secluded. It is the home of the Archean granite,
and its basins are of a fathomless dust. Under
its sagebrush wastes the skeletons of earth&#8217;s hugest
mammals lie beside behemoth and the monsters
of the deep. The eternal snow, the granite peak,
the sandstone butte, the lava-bed, the gray desert,
the far horizon are familiar here. With the sunniest
and bluest of skies, this is the range of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
deadliest storms, and its delightful summers contrast
with the dreadest cold.</p>
<p>Here the desert of death simulates a field of
cooling snow, green hills lie black in the dazzling
light of day, limpid waters run green over arsenic
stone, and sunset betricks the fantastic rock with
column and capital and dome. Clouds burst here
above arid wastes, and where dew is precious the
skies are most prodigal in their downpour. If the
torrent bed is dry, distrust it.</p>
<p>This vast mountain shed parts rivers whose
waters find two oceans, and their valleys are the
natural highways up which railroads wind to the
crest of the continent. To the mountain engineer
the waterway is the sphinx that holds in its silence
the riddle of his success; with him lies the problem
of providing a railway across ranges which often
defy the hoofs of a horse.</p>
<p>The construction engineer studies the course of
the mountain water. The water is both his ally
and his enemy&ndash;&ndash;ally because it alone has made possible
his undertakings; enemy because it fights to
destroy his puny work, just as it fights to level the
barriers that oppose him. Like acid spread on
copperplate, water etches the canyons in the mountain
slopes and spreads wide the valleys through
the plains. Among these scarcely known ranges
of the Rocky Mountain chain the Western rivers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
have their beginnings. When white men crowded
the Indian from the plains he retreated to the
mountains, and in their valleys made his final
stand against the aggressor. The scroll of this
invasion of the mountain West by the white man
has been unrolled, read, and put away within
a hundred years, and of the agencies that made
possible the swiftness of the story transportation
overshadows all others. The first railroad put
across those mountains cost twenty-five thousand
miles of reconnaissances and fifteen thousand
miles of instrument surveys. Since the day of that
undertaking a generation of men has passed, and
in the interval the wilderness that those men penetrated
has been transformed. The Indian no
longer extorts terms from his foe: he is not.</p>
<p>Where the tepee stood the rodman drives his
stakes, and the country of the great Indian rivers,
save one, has been opened for years to the railroad.
That one is the Crawling Stone. The
valley of Crawling Stone River marked for more
than a decade the dead line between the Overland
Route of the white man and the last country of
the Sioux. It was long after the building of the
first line before even an engineer&#8217;s reconnaissance
was made in the Crawling Stone country. Then,
within ten years, three surveys were made, two on
the north side of the river and one on the south
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
side, by interests seeking a coast outlet. Three
reports made in this way gave varying estimates of
the expense of putting a line up the valley, but
the three coincided in this, that the cost would
be prohibitive. Engineers of reputation had in
this respect agreed, but Glover, who looked after
such work for Bucks, remained unconvinced, and
before McCloud was put into the operating department
on the Short Line he was asked by Glover to
run a preliminary up Crawling Stone Valley. Before
the date of his report the conclusions reached
by other engineers had stood unchallenged.</p>
<p>The valley was not unknown to McCloud.
His first year in the mountains, in which, fitted as
thoroughly as he could fit himself for his profession,
he had come West and found himself unable
to get work, had been spent hunting, fishing, and
wandering, often cold and often hungry, in the
upper Crawling Stone country. The valley in
itself offers to a constructionist no insuperable
obstacles; the difficulty is presented in the canyon
where the river bursts through the Elbow Mountains.
South of this canyon, McCloud, one day on
a hunting trip, found himself with two Indians
pocketed in the rough country, and was planning
how to escape passing a night away from camp
when his companions led him past a vertical wall
of rock a thousand feet high, split into a narrow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
defile down which they rode, as it broadened out,
for miles. They emerged upon an open country
that led without a break into the valley of the
Crawling Stone below the canyon. Afterward,
when he had become a railroad man, McCloud, sitting
at a camp-fire with Glover and Morris Blood,
heard them discussing the coveted and impossible
line up the valley. He had been taken into the
circle of constructionists and was told of the earlier
reports against the line. He thought he knew
something about the Elbow Mountains, and disputed
the findings, offering in two days&#8217; ride to
take the men before him to the pass called by the
Indians The Box, and to take them through it.
Glover called it a find, and a big one, and though
more immediate matters in the strategy of territorial
control then came before him, the preliminary
was ordered and McCloud&#8217;s findings were
approved. McCloud himself was soon afterward
engrossed in the problems of operating the
mountain division; but the dream of his life was
to build the Crawling Stone Line with a maximum
grade of eight tenths through The Box.</p>
<p>The prettiest stretch of Crawling Stone Valley
lies within twenty miles of Medicine Bend. There
it lies widest, and has the pick of water and grass
between Medicine Bend and the Mission Mountains.
Cattlemen went into the Crawling Stone
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
country before the Indians had wholly left it. The
first house in the valley was the Stone Ranch, built
by Richard Dunning, and it still stands overlooking
the town of Dunning at the junction of the
Frenchman Creek with the Crawling Stone. The
Frenchman is fed by unfailing springs, and when
by summer sun and wind every smaller stream in
the middle basin has been licked dry, the Frenchman
runs cold and swift between its russet hills.
Richard Dunning, being on the border of the Indian
country, built for his ranch-house a rambling
stone fortress. He had chosen, it afterward
proved, the choice spot in the valley, and he
stocked it with cattle when yearlings could be
picked up in Medicine Bend at ten dollars a head.
He got together a great body of valley land when
it could be had for the asking, and became the
rich man of the Long Range.</p>
<p>The Dunnings were Kentuckians. Richard was
a bridge engineer and builder, and under Brodie
built some of the first bridges on the mountain division,
notably the great wooden bridge at Smoky
Creek. Richard brought out his nephew, Lance
Dunning. He taught Lance bridge-building, and
Murray Sinclair, who began as a cowboy on the
Stone Ranch, learned bridge-building from Richard
Dunning. The Dunnings both came West, though
at different times, as young men and unmarried,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
and, as far as Western women were concerned,
might always have remained so. But a Kentucky
cousin, Betty, one of the Fairfield Dunnings, related
to Richard within the sixth or eighth degree, came
to the mountains for her health. Betty&#8217;s mother
had brought Richard up as a boy, and Betty, when
he left Fairfield, was a baby. But Dick&ndash;&ndash;as they
knew him at home&ndash;&ndash;and the mother wrote back
and forth, and he persuaded her to send Betty out
for a trip, promising he would send her back in a
year a well woman.</p>
<p>Betty came with only her colored maid, old
Puss Dunning, who had taken her from the nurse&#8217;s
arms when she was born and taken care of her
ever since. The two&ndash;&ndash;the tall Kentucky girl and
the bent mammy&ndash;&ndash;arrived at the Stone Ranch
one day in June, and Richard, done then with
bridges and looking after his ranch interests, had
already fallen violently in love with Betty. She
was delicate, but, if those in Medicine Bend who
remembered her said true, a lovely creature. Remaining
in the mountains was the last thing Betty
had ever thought of, but no one, man or woman,
could withstand Dick Dunning. She fell quite in
love with him the first time she set eyes on him in
Medicine Bend, for he was very handsome in the
saddle, and Betty was fairly wild about horses. So
Dick Dunning wooed a fond mistress and married
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
her and buried her, and all within hardly more
than a year.</p>
<p>But in that year they were very happy, never two
happier, and when she slept away her suffering she
left him, as a legacy, a tiny baby girl. Puss
brought the mite of a creature in its swaddling-clothes
to the sick mother,&ndash;&ndash;very, very sick then,&ndash;&ndash;and
poor Betty turned her dark eyes on it, kissed
it, looked at her husband and whispered &#8220;Dicksie,&#8221;
and died. Dicksie had been Betty&#8217;s pet
name for her mountain lover, so the father said the
child&#8217;s name should be Dicksie and nothing else;
and his heart broke and soon he died. Nothing
else, storm or flood, death or disaster, had ever
moved Dick Dunning; then a single blow killed
him. He rode once in a while over the ranch, a
great tract by that time of twenty thousand acres,
all in one body, all under fence, up and down both
sides of the big river, in part irrigated, swarming
with cattle&ndash;&ndash;none of it stirred Dick! and with little
Dicksie in his arms he slept away his suffering.</p>
<p>So Dicksie was left, as her mother had been, to
Puss, while Lance looked after the ranch, swore at
the price of cattle, and played cards at Medicine
Bend. At ten, Dicksie, as thoroughly spoiled as a
pet baby could be by a fool mammy, a fond cousin,
and a galaxy of devoted cowboys, was sent, in spite
of crying and flinging, to a far-away convent&ndash;&ndash;her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
father had planned everything&ndash;&ndash;where in many
tears she learned that there were other things in the
world besides cattle and mountains and sunshine
and tall, broad-hatted horsemen to swing from
their stirrups and pick her hat from the ground&ndash;&ndash;just
to see little Dicksie laugh&ndash;&ndash;when they swooped
past the house to the corrals. When she came
back from Kentucky, her grandmother dead and
her schooldays finished, all the land she could see
in the valley was hers, and all the living creatures
in the fields. It seemed perfectly natural, because
since childhood even the distant mountains and
their snows had been Dicksie&#8217;s.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>THE FINAL APPEAL</h3>
</div>
<p>Sinclair&#8217;s discharge was a matter of comment
for the whole country, from the ranch-houses
to the ranges. For a time Sinclair himself
refused utterly to believe that McCloud could keep
him off the division. His determination to get
back led him to carry his appeal to the highest
quarters, to Glover and to Bucks himself. But
Sinclair, able as he was, had passed the limit of
endurance and had long been marked for an accounting.
He had been a railroad man to whom
the West spelled license, and, while a valuable man,
had long been a source of demoralization to the
forces of the division. In the railroad life clearly
defined plans are often too deeply laid to fathom,
and it was impossible for even so acute a man as
Sinclair to realize that he was not the victim of an
accident, but that he must look to his own record
for the real explanation of his undoing. He was
not the only man to suffer in the shake-out that
took place under the new superintendent; but he
seemed the only one unable to realize that Bucks,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
patient and long-suffering, had put McCloud into
the mountain saddle expressly to deal with cases
such as his. In the West sympathy is quick but
not always discerning. Medicine Bend took Sinclair&#8217;s
grievance as its own. No other man in the
service had Sinclair&#8217;s following, and within a
week petitions were being circulated through the
town not asking merely but calling for his reinstatement.
The sporting element of the community
to a man were behind Sinclair because he
was a sport; the range men were with him because
his growing ranch on the Frenchman made him
one of them; his own men were with him because
he was a far-seeing pirate and divided liberally.
Among the railroad men, too, he had much sympathy.
Sinclair had always been lavish with presents;
brides were remembered by Sinclair, and
babies were not forgotten. He could sit up all
night with a railroad man that had been hurt, and
he could play poker all night with one that was
not afraid of getting hurt. In his way, he was a
division autocrat, whose vices were varnished by
virtues such as these. His hold on the people was
so strong that they could not believe the company
would not reinstate him. In spite of the appointment
of his successor, Phil Hailey, a mountain boy
and the son of an old-time bridge foreman, rumor
assigned again and again definite dates for Sinclair&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
return to work; but the dates never materialized.
The bridge machinery of the big division
moved on in even rhythm. A final and determined
appeal from the deposed autocrat for a hearing
at last brought Glover and Morris Blood, the
general manager, to Medicine Bend for a final
conference. Callahan too was there with his pipe,
and they talked quietly with Sinclair&ndash;&ndash;reminded
him of how often he had been warned, showed
him how complete a record they had of his plundering,
and Glover gave to him Bucks&#8217;s final word
that he could never again work on the mountain
division.</p>
<p>A pride grown monstrous with prestige long undisputed
broke under the final blow. The big fellow
put his face in his hands and burst into tears,
and the men before him sat confused and uncomfortable
at his outburst of feeling. It was only
for a moment. Sinclair raised his hand, shook his
long hair, and swore an oath against the company
and the men that curled the very smoke in Callahan&#8217;s
pipe, Callahan, outraged at the insolence,
sprang to his feet, resenting Sinclair&#8217;s fury.
Choking with anger he warned him not to go
too far. The two were ready to spring at each
other&#8217;s throat when Farrell Kennedy stepped between
them. Sinclair, drunk with rage, called for
McCloud; but he submitted quietly to Kennedy&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
reproof, and with a semblance of self-control
begged that McCloud be sent for. Kennedy,
without complying, gradually pushed Sinclair out
of the room and, without seeming officious, walked
with him down the hall and quite out of the
building.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>IN MARION&#8217;S SHOP</h3>
</div>
<p>In Boney Street, Medicine Bend, stands an early-day
row of one-story buildings; they once
made up a prosperous block, which has long since
fallen into the decay of paintless days. There is
in Boney Street a livery stable, a second-hand
store, a laundry, a bakery, a moribund grocery,
and a bicycle shop, and at the time of this story
there was also Marion Sinclair&#8217;s millinery shop;
but the better class of Medicine Bend business,
such as the gambling houses, saloons, pawnshops,
restaurants, barber shops, and those sensitive,
clean-shaven, and alert establishments known as
&#8220;gents&#8217; stores,&#8221; had deserted Boney Street for
many years. Bats fly in the dark of Boney Street
while Front Street at the same hour is a blaze of
electricity and frontier hilarity. The millinery store
stood next to the corner of Fort Street. The lot
lay in an &#8220;L,&#8221; and at the rear of the store the
first owner had built a small connecting cottage to
live in. This faced on Fort Street, so that Marion
had her shop and living-rooms communicating,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
and yet apart. The store building is still pointed
out as the former shop of Marion Sinclair, where
George McCloud boarded when the Crawling
Stone Line was built, where Whispering Smith
might often have been seen, where Sinclair himself
was last seen alive in Medicine Bend, where
Dicksie Dunning&#8217;s horse dragged her senseless one
wild mountain night, and where, indeed, for a
time the affairs of the whole mountain division
seemed to tangle in very hard knots.</p>
<p>As to the millinery business, it was never, after
Marion bought the shop, more than moderately
successful. The demand that existed in Medicine
Bend for red hats of the picture sort Marion declined
to recognize. For customers who sought
these she turned out hats of sombre coloring calculated
to inspire gloom rather than revelry, and she
naturally failed to hold what might be termed the
miscellaneous business. But after Dicksie Dunning
of the Stone Ranch, fresh from the convent,
rode into the shop, or if not into it nearly so,
and, gliding through the door, ordered a hat
out of hand, Marion always had some business.
All Medicine Bend knew Dicksie Dunning, who
dressed stunningly, rode famously, and was so
winningly democratic that half the town never
called her anything, at a distance, but Dicksie.</p>
<p>The first hat was a small affair but haughty.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
The materials were unheard of in Marion&#8217;s stock
and had to be sent for. Marion&#8217;s arrangements
with the jobbing houses always had a C. O. D.
complexion; the jobbers maintained that this
saved book-keeping, and Marion, who of course
never knew any better, paid the double express
charges like a lamb. She acted, too, as banker for
the other impecunious tradespeople in the block,
and as this included nearly all of them she was
often pressed for funds herself. McCloud undertook
sometimes to intervene and straighten out
her millinery affairs. One evening he went so
far as to attempt an inventory of her stock and
some schedule of her accounts; but Marion, with
the front-shop curtains closely drawn and McCloud
perspiring on a step-ladder, inspecting boxes
of feathers and asking stern questions, would look
so pathetically sweet and helpless when she tried to
recall what things cost that McCloud could not
be angry with her; indeed, the pretty eyes behind
the patient spectacles would disarm any one. In
the end he took inventory on the basis of the retail
prices, dividing it afterward by five, as Marion estimated
the average profit in the business at five
hundred per cent.&ndash;&ndash;this being what the woman she
bought out had told her.</p>
<p>How then, McCloud asked himself, could Marion
be normally hard pressed for money? He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
talked to her learnedly about fixed charges, but
even these seemed difficult to arrive at. There
was no rent, because the building belonged to the
railroad company, and when the real-estate and
tax man came around and talked to McCloud
about rent for the Boney Street property, McCloud
told him to chase himself. There was no insurance,
because no one would dream of insuring
Marion&#8217;s stock boxes; there were no bills payable,
because no travelling man would advise a line of
credit to an inexperienced and, what was worse, an
unpractical milliner. Marion did her own trimming,
so there were no salaries except to Katie
Dancing. It puzzled McCloud to find the leak.
How could he know that Marion was keeping
nearly all the block supplied with funds? So
McCloud continued to raise the price of his table-board,
and, though Marion insisted he was paying
her too much, held that he must be eating her out
of house and home.</p>
<p>In her dining-room, which connected through a
curtained door with the shop, McCloud sat one
day alone eating his dinner. Marion was in front
serving a customer. McCloud heard voices in
the shop, but gave no heed till a man walked
through the curtained doorway and he saw Murray
Sinclair standing before him. The stormy interview
with Callahan and Blood at the Wickiup
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
had taken place just a week before, and McCloud,
after what Sinclair had then threatened, though
not prepared, felt as he saw him that anything
might occur. McCloud being in possession of the
little room, however, the initiative fell on Sinclair,
who, looking his best, snatched his hat from his
head and bowed ironically. &#8220;My mistake,&#8221; he
said blandly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come right in,&#8221; returned McCloud, not knowing
whether Marion had a possible hand in
her husband&#8217;s unexpected appearance. &#8220;Do you
want to see me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t,&#8221; smiled Sinclair; &#8220;and to be perfectly
frank,&#8221; he added with studied consideration, &#8220;I
wish to God I never had seen you. Well&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;ve
thrown me, McCloud.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve thrown yourself, haven&#8217;t you, Murray?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From your point of view, of course. But,
McCloud, this is a small country for two points of
view. Do you want to get out of it, or do you
want me to?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The country suits me, Sinclair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No man that has ever played me dirt can
stay here while I stay.&#8221; Sinclair, with a hand on
the porti&egrave;re, was moving from the doorway into
the room. McCloud in a leisurely way rose,
though with a slightly flushed face, and at that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
juncture Marion ran into the room and spoke
abruptly. &#8220;Here is the silk, Mr. Sinclair,&#8221; she
exclaimed, handing to him a package she had not
finished wrapping. &#8220;I meant you to wait in the
other room.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was an accidental intrusion,&#8221; returned Sinclair,
maintaining his irony. &#8220;I have apologized,
and Mr. McCloud and I understand one another
better than ever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please say to Miss Dunning,&#8221; continued Marion,
nervous and insistent, &#8220;that the band for her
riding-hat hasn&#8217;t come yet, but it should be here
to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>As she spoke McCloud leaned across the table,
resolved to take advantage of the opening, if it
cost him his life. &#8220;And by the way, Mr. Sinclair,
Miss Dunning wished me to say to you that the
lovely bay colt you sent her had sprung his shoulder
badly, the hind shoulder, I think, but they are
doing everything possible for it and they think it
will make a great horse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sinclair&#8217;s snort at the information was a marvel
of indecision. Was he being made fun of?
Should he draw and end it? But Marion faced
him resolutely as he stood, and talking in the most
business-like way she backed him out of the room
and to the shop door. Balked of his opportunity,
he retreated stubbornly but with the utmost politeness,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
and left with a grin, lashing his tail, so
to speak.</p>
<p>Coming back, Marion tried to hide her uneasiness
under even tones to McCloud. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry
he disturbed you. I was attending to a customer
and had to ask him to wait a moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t apologize for having a customer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He lives over beyond the Stone Ranch, you
know, and is taking some things out for the Dunnings
to-day. He likes an excuse to come in here
because it annoys me. Finish your dinner, Mr.
McCloud.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, I&#8217;m done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you haven&#8217;t eaten anything. Isn&#8217;t your
steak right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fine, but that man&ndash;&ndash;well, you know how I
like him and how he likes me. I&#8217;ll content myself
with digesting my temper.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>SMOKY CREEK BRIDGE</h3>
</div>
<p>It was not alone that a defiance makes a bad dinner
sauce: there was more than this for McCloud
to feed on. He was forced to confess to
himself as he walked back to the Wickiup that the
most annoying feature of the incident was the least
important, namely, that his only enemy in the country
should be intrusted with commissions from the
Stone Ranch and be carrying packages for Dicksie
Dunning. It was Sinclair&#8217;s trick to do things for
people, and to make himself so useful that they
must like first his obligingness and afterward himself.
Sinclair, McCloud knew, was close in many
ways to Lance Dunning. It was said to have been
his influence that won Dunning&#8217;s consent to sell a
right of way across the ranch for the new Crawling
Stone Line. But McCloud felt it useless to disguise
the fact to himself that he now had a second keen
interest in the Crawling Stone country&ndash;&ndash;not alone
a dream of a line, but a dream of a girl. Sitting
moodily in his office, with his feet on the desk, a
few nights after his encounter with Sinclair, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
recalled her nod as she said good-by. It had
seemed the least bit encouraging, and he meditated
anew on the only twenty minutes of real pleasurable
excitement he had ever felt in his life, the
twenty minutes with Dicksie Dunning at Smoky
Creek. Her intimates, he had heard, called her
Dicksie, and he was vaguely envying her intimates
when the night despatcher, Rooney Lee, opened the
door and disturbed his reflections.</p>
<p>&#8220;How is Number One, Rooney?&#8221; called McCloud,
as if nothing but the thought of a
train movement ever entered his head.</p>
<p>Rooney Lee paused. In his hand he held a message.
Rooney&#8217;s cheeks were hollow and his sunken
eyes were large. His face, which was singularly
a night face, would shock a stranger, but any man
on the division would have given his life for
Rooney. The simple fellow had but two living
interests&ndash;&ndash;his train-sheets and his chewing tobacco.
Sometimes I think that every railroad man earns
his salary&ndash;&ndash;even the president. But Rooney was
a Past Worthy Master in that unnumbered lodge
of railroad slaves who do killing work and have
left, when they die, only a little tobacco to show
for it. It was on Rooney&#8217;s account that McCloud&#8217;s
order banishing cuspidors from his office
had been rescinded. A few evenings of agony
on the despatcher&#8217;s part when in consultation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
with his chief, the mournful wandering of his
uncomplaining eyes, his struggle to raise an obstinate
window before he could answer a question,
would have moved a heart harder than
McCloud&#8217;s. The cuspidor had been restored to
one corner of the large room, and to this corner
Rooney, like a man with a jaw full of birdshot, always
walked first. When he turned back to face his
chief his face had lost its haunted expression, and he
answered with solemn cheer, &#8220;On time,&#8221; or
&#8220;Fourteen minutes late,&#8221; as the case might be.
This night his face showed something out of the
ordinary, and he faced McCloud with evident uneasiness.
&#8220;Holy smoke, Mr. McCloud, here&#8217;s a
ripper! We&#8217;ve lost Smoky Creek Bridge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lost Smoky Creek Bridge?&#8221; echoed McCloud,
rising in amazement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Burned to-night. Seventy-seven was flagged
by the man at the pump station.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a tie-up for your life!&#8221; exclaimed McCloud,
reaching for the message. &#8220;How could it
catch fire? Is it burned up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t get anything on that yet; this came
from Canby. I&#8217;ll have a good wire in a few minutes
and get it all for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have Phil Hailey and Hyde notified, Rooney,
and Reed and Brill Young, and get up a train.
Smoky Creek Bridge! By heavens, we are ripped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
up the back now! What can we do there,
Rooney?&#8221; He was talking to himself. &#8220;There
isn&#8217;t a thing for it on God&#8217;s earth but switchbacks
and five-per-cent. grades down to the bottom of the
creek and cribbing across it till the new line is
ready. Wire Callahan and Morris Blood, and get
everything you can for me before we start.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ten hours later and many hundreds of miles
from the mountain division, President Bucks and a
companion were riding in the peace of a June morning
down the beautiful Mohawk Valley with an
earlier and illustrious railroad man, William C.
Brown. The three men were at breakfast in
Brown&#8217;s car. A message was brought in for Bucks.
He read it and passed it to his companion, Whispering
Smith, who sat at Brown&#8217;s left hand. The
message was from Callahan with the news of the
burning of Smoky Creek Bridge. Details were
few, because no one on the West End could suggest
a plausible cause for the fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think of it, Gordon?&#8221; demanded
Bucks bluntly.</p>
<p>Whispering Smith seemed at all times bordering
on good-natured surprise, and in that normal condition
he read Callahan&#8217;s message. Everything
surprised Whispering Smith, even his salary; but
an important consequence was that nothing excited
him. He seemed to accommodate himself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
to the unexpected through habitual surprise. It
showed markedly in his eyes, which were bright
and quite wide open, and, save for his eyes, no feature
about him would fix itself in the memory. His
round, pleasant face, his heavy brown mustache, the
medium build that concealed under its commonplace
symmetry an unusual strength, his slightly
rounding shoulders bespeaking a not too serious
estimate of himself&ndash;&ndash;every characteristic, even to
his unobtrusive suit and black hat, made him distinctly
an ordinary man&ndash;&ndash;one to be met in the
street to-day and passed, and forgotten to-morrow.</p>
<p>He was laughing under Bucks&#8217;s scrutiny when he
handed the message back. &#8220;Why, I don&#8217;t know
a thing about it, not a thing; but taking a long shot
and speaking by and far, I should say it looks
something like first blood for Sinclair,&#8221; he suggested,
and to change the subject lifted his cup of
coffee.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it looks like you for the mountains to-night
instead of for Weber and Fields&#8217;s,&#8221; retorted
Bucks, reaching for a cigar. &#8220;Brown, why have
you never learned to smoke?&#8221;</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_IX_THE_MISUNDERSTANDING' id='CHAPTER_IX_THE_MISUNDERSTANDING'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>THE MISUNDERSTANDING</h3>
</div>
<p>No attempt was made to minimize the truth
that the blow to the division was a staggering
one. The loss of Smoky Creek Bridge put
almost a thousand miles of the mountain division
out of business. Perishable freight and time freight
were diverted to other lines. Passengers were
transferred; lunches were served to them in the deep
valley, and they were supplied by an ingenuous advertising
department with pictures of the historic
bridge as it had long stood, and their addresses
were taken with the promise of a picture of the
ruins. Smoky Creek Bridge had long been famous
in mountain song and story. For one generation
of Western railroad men it had stood as a monument
to the earliest effort to conquer the Rockies
with a railroad. Built long before the days of
steel, this high and slender link in the first transcontinental
line had for thirty years served faithfully
at its danger-post, only to fall in the end at the
hands of a bridge assassin; nor has the mystery of
its fate ever completely been solved, though
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
it is believed to lie with Murray Sinclair in the
Frenchman hills. The engineering department
and the operating department united in a tremendous
effort to bring about a resumption of traffic.
Glover&#8217;s men, pulled off construction, were sent
forward in trainloads. Dancing&#8217;s linemen strung
arc-lights along the creek until the canyon twinkled
at night like a mountain village, and men in three
shifts worked elbow to elbow unceasingly to run
the switchbacks down to the creek-bed. There,
by cribbing across the bottom, they got in a
temporary line.</p>
<p>Train movement was thrown into a spectacle of
confusion. Upon the incessant and well-ordered
activities of the road the burning of the bridge fell
like the heel of a heavy boot on an ant-hill; but the
railroad men like ants rose to the emergency, and,
where the possible failed, achieved the impossible.</p>
<p>McCloud spent his days at the creek and his
nights at Medicine Bend with his assistant and his
chief despatcher, advising, counselling, studying
out trouble reports, and steadying wherever he
could the weakened lines of his operating forces.
He was getting his first taste of the trials of the
hardest-worked and poorest-paid man in the operating
department of a railroad&ndash;&ndash;the division
superintendent.</p>
<p>To these were added personal annoyances. A
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
trainload of Duck Bar steers, shipped by Lance
Dunning from the Crawling Stone Ranch, had been
caught west of the bridge the very night of the
fire. They had been loaded at Tipton and shipped
to catch a good market, and under extravagant
promises from the live-stock agent of a quick run
to Chicago. When Lance Dunning learned that
his cattle had been caught west of the break and
would have to be unloaded, he swore up a horse in
hot haste and started for Medicine Bend. McCloud,
who had not closed his eyes for sixty hours,
had just got into Medicine Bend from Smoky
Creek and was sitting at his desk buried in a mass
of papers, but he ordered the cattleman admitted.
He was, in fact, eager to meet the manager of the
big ranch and the cousin of Dicksie. Lance Dunning
stood above six feet in height, and was a handsome
man, in spite of the hard lines around his
eyes, as he walked in; but neither his manner nor
his expression was amiable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you Mr. McCloud? I&#8217;ve been here three
times this afternoon to see you,&#8221; said he, ignoring
McCloud&#8217;s answer and a proffered chair. &#8220;This
is your office, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>McCloud, a little surprised, answered again
and civilly: &#8220;It certainly is; but I have been at
Smoky Creek for two or three days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What have you done with my cattle?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span></div>
<p>&#8220;The Duck Bar train was run back to Point of
Rocks and the cattle were unloaded at the yard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lance Dunning spoke with increasing harshness:
&#8220;By whose order was that done? Why wasn&#8217;t
I notified? Have they had feed or water?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All the stock caught west of the bridge was
sent back for feed and water by my orders. It
has all been taken care of. You should have been
notified, certainly; it is the business of the stock
agent to see to that. Let me inquire about it while
you are here, Mr. Dunning,&#8221; suggested McCloud,
ringing for his clerk.</p>
<p>Dunning lost no time in expressing himself. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t want my cattle held at Point of Rocks!&#8221; he
said angrily. &#8220;Your Point of Rocks yards are
infected. My cattle shouldn&#8217;t have been sent
there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no! The old yards where they had a
touch of fever were burned off the face of the earth
a year ago. The new yards are perfectly sanitary.
The loss of the bridge has crippled us, you know.
Your cattle are being well cared for, Mr. Dunning,
and if you doubt it you may go up and give our
men any orders you like in the matter at our
expense.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re taking altogether too much on yourself
when you run my stock over the country in this
way,&#8221; exclaimed Dunning, refusing to be placated.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span></div>
<p>&#8220;How am I to get to Point of Rocks&ndash;&ndash;walk
there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; returned McCloud, ringing up
his clerk and asking for a pass, which was brought
back in a moment and handed to Dunning. &#8220;The
cattle,&#8221; continued McCloud, &#8220;can be run down,
unloaded, and driven around the break to-morrow&ndash;&ndash;with
the loss of only two days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And in the meantime I lose my market.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is too bad, certainly, but I suppose it will be
several days before we can get a line across Smoky
Creek.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why weren&#8217;t the cattle sent through that way
yesterday? What have they been held at Point
of Rocks for? I call the thing badly managed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We couldn&#8217;t get the empty cars up from Piedmont
for the transfer until to-day; empties are
very scarce everywhere now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There always have been empties here when
they were wanted until lately. There&#8217;s been no
head or tail to anything on this division for six
months.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry that you have that impression.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That impression is very general,&#8221; declared the
stockman, with an oath, &#8220;and if you keep on discharging
the only men on this division that are
competent to handle a break like this, it is likely to
continue!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Just a moment!&#8221; McCloud&#8217;s finger rose
pointedly. &#8220;My failure to please you in caring
for your stock in an emergency may be properly
a matter for comment; your opinion as to
the way I am running this division is, of course,
your own: but don&#8217;t attempt to criticise the retention
or discharge of any man on my payroll!&#8221;</p>
<p>Dunning strode toward him. &#8220;I&#8217;m a shipper
on this line; when it suits me to criticise you or your
methods, or anybody else&#8217;s, I expect to do so,&#8221; he
retorted in high tones.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you cannot tell me how to run my business!&#8221;
thundered McCloud, leaning over the table
in front of him.</p>
<p>As the two men glared at each other Rooney
Lee opened the door. His surprise at the situation
amounted to consternation. He shuffled to
the corner of the room, and while McCloud and
Dunning engaged hotly again, Rooney, from the
corner, threw a shot of his own into the quarrel.
&#8220;On time!&#8221; he roared.</p>
<p>The angry men turned. &#8220;What&#8217;s on time?&#8221;
asked McCloud curtly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Number One; she&#8217;s in and changing engines.
I told them you were going West,&#8221; declared
Rooney in so deep tones that his fiction would
never have been suspected. If his cue had been,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
&#8220;My lord, the conductor waits,&#8221; it could not have
been rung in more opportunely.</p>
<p>Dunning, to emphasize, without a further word,
his disgust for the situation and his contempt for
the management, tore into scraps the pass that had
been given him, threw the scraps on the floor, took
a cigar from his pocket and lighted it; insolence
could do no more.</p>
<p>McCloud looked over at the despatcher. &#8220;No,
I am not going West, Rooney. But if you will be
good enough to stay here and find out from this
man just how this railroad ought to be run, I will
go to bed. He can tell you; the microbe seems to
be working in his mind right now,&#8221; said McCloud,
slamming down the roll-top of his desk. And
with Lance Dunning glaring at him, somewhat
speechless, he put on his hat and walked out of
the room.</p>
<p>It was but one of many disagreeable incidents
due to the loss of the bridge. Complications arising
from the tie-up followed him at every turn. It
seemed as if he could not get away from trouble
following trouble. After forty hours further of toil,
relieved by four hours of sleep, McCloud found
himself, rather dead than alive, back at Medicine
Bend and in the little dining-room at Marion&#8217;s.
Coming in at the cottage door on Fort Street, he
dropped into a chair. The cottage rooms were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
empty. He heard Marion&#8217;s voice in the front
shop; she was engaged with a customer. Putting
his head on the table to wait a moment, nature
asserted itself and McCloud fell asleep. He woke
hearing a voice that he had heard in dreams. Perhaps
no other voice could have wakened him, for
he slept for a few minutes a death-like sleep. At
all events, Dicksie Dunning was in the front room
and McCloud heard her. She was talking with
Marion about the burning of Smoky Creek Bridge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every one is talking about it yet,&#8221; Dicksie was
saying. &#8220;If I had lost my best friend I couldn&#8217;t
have felt worse; you know, my father built it. I
rode over there the day of the fire, and down into
the creek, so I could look up where it stood. I
never realized before how high and how long it
was; and when I remembered how proud father
always was of his work there&ndash;&ndash;Cousin Lance has
often told me&ndash;&ndash;I sat down right on the ground and
cried. Really, the ruins were the most pathetic
thing you ever saw, Marion, with great clouds of
smoke rolling up from the canyon that day; the
place looked so lonely when I rode away that every
time I turned to look back my eyes filled with tears.
Poor daddy! I am almost glad he didn&#8217;t live to
see it. How times have changed in railroading,
haven&#8217;t they? Mr. Sinclair was over just the
other night, and he said if they kept using this new
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
coal in the engines they would burn up everything
on the division. Do you know, I have been waiting
in town three or four hours now for Cousin
Lance? I feel almost like a tramp. He is coming
from the West with the stock train. It was due
here hours ago, but they never seem to know when
anything is to get here the way things are run on
the railroad now. I want to give Cousin Lance
some mail before he goes through.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The passenger trains crossed the creek over
the switchbacks hours ago, and they say the emergency
grades are first-rate,&#8221; said Marion Sinclair,
on the defensive. &#8220;The stock trains must have
followed right along. Your cousin is sure to be
here pretty soon. Probably Mr. McCloud will
know which train he is on, and Mr. Lee telephoned
that Mr. McCloud would be over here at three
o&#8217;clock for his dinner. He ought to be here now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear, then I must go!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But he can probably tell you just when your
cousin will be in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t meet him for worlds!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t? Why, Mr. McCloud is delightful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, not for worlds, Marion! You know he
is discharging all the best of the older men, the
men that have made the road everything it is, and
of course we can&#8217;t help sympathizing with them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
over our way. For my part, I think it is terrible,
after a man has given all of his life to building up
a railroad, that he should be thrown out to starve
in that way by new managers, Marion.&#8221;</p>
<p>McCloud felt himself shrinking within his weary
clothes. Resentment seemed to have died. He
felt too exhausted to undertake controversy, even
if it were to be thought of, and it was not.</p>
<p>Nothing further was needed to complete his
humiliation. He picked up his hat and with the
thought of getting out as quietly as he had come
in. In rising he swept a tumbler at his elbow from
the table. The glass broke on the floor, and Marion
exclaimed, &#8220;What is that?&#8221; and started for
the dining-room.</p>
<p>It was too late to get away. McCloud stepped
to the porti&egrave;res of the trimming-room door and
pushed them aside. Marion stood with a hat in
her hand, and Dicksie, sitting at the table, was
looking directly at the intruder as he appeared in
the doorway. She saw in him her pleasant acquaintance
of the wreck at Smoky Creek, whose
name she had not learned. In her surprise she
rose to her feet, and Marion spoke quickly: &#8220;Oh,
Mr. McCloud, is it you? I did not hear you
come in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dicksie&#8217;s face, which had lighted, became a
spectacle of confusion after she heard the name.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
McCloud, conscious of the awkwardness of his
position and the disorder of his garb, said the
worst thing at once: &#8220;I fear I am inadvertently
overhearing your conversation.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at Dicksie as he spoke, chiefly because
he could not help it, and this made matters
hopeless.</p>
<p>She flushed more deeply. &#8220;I cannot conceive
why our conversation should invite a listener.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her words did not, of course, help to steady
him. &#8220;I tried to get away,&#8221; he stammered,
&#8220;when I realized I was a part of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In any event,&#8221; she exclaimed hastily, &#8220;if you
are Mr. McCloud I think it unpardonable to do
anything like that!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Mr. McCloud, though I should rather
be anybody else; and I am sorry that I was unable
to help hearing what was said; I&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Marion, will you be kind enough to give me
my gloves?&#8221; said Dicksie, holding out her hand.</p>
<p>Marion, having tried once or twice to intervene,
stood between the firing-lines in helpless amazement.
Her exclamations were lost; the two before
her gave no heed to ordinary intervention.</p>
<p>McCloud flushed at being cut off, but he bowed.
&#8220;Of course,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if you will listen to no
explanation I can only withdraw.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went back, dinnerless, to work all night;
but the switchbacks were doing capitally, and all
night long, trains were rolling through Medicine
Bend from the West in an endless string. In the
morning the yard was nearly cleared of westbound
tonnage. Moreover, the mail in the morning
brought compensation. A letter came from Glover
telling him not to worry himself to death over the
tie-up, and one came from Bucks telling him to
make ready for the building of the Crawling Stone
Line.</p>
<p>McCloud told Rooney Lee that if anybody
asked for him to report him dead, and going to
bed slept twenty-four hours.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>SWEEPING ORDERS</h3>
</div>
<p>The burning of Smoky Creek Bridge was
hardly off the minds of the mountain men
when a disaster of a different sort befell the division.
In the Rat Valley east of Sleepy Cat the
main line springs between two ranges of hills with
a dip and a long supported grade in each direction.
At the point of the dip there is a switch from
which a spur runs to a granite quarry. The track
for two miles is straight and the switch-target and
lights are seen easily from either direction save
at one particular moment of the day&ndash;&ndash;a moment
which is in the valley neither quite day nor
quite night. Even this disadvantage occurs to
trains east-bound only, because due to unusual
circumstances. When the sun in a burst of dawning
glory shows itself above the crest of the
eastern range an engineman, east-bound, may be
so blinded by the rays streaming from the rising
sun that he cannot see the switch at the foot of
the grade. For these few moments he is helpless
should anything be wrong with the quarry switch.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
Down this grade, a few weeks after the Smoky
Creek fire, came a double-headed stock train from
the Short Line with forty cars of steers. The
switch stood open; this much was afterward abundantly
proved. The train came down the grade
very fast to gain speed for the hill ahead of it.
The head engineman, too late, saw the open target.
He applied the emergency air, threw his
engine over, and whistled the alarm. The mightiest
efforts of a dozen engines would have been
powerless to check the heavy train. On the quarry
track stood three flat cars loaded with granite
blocks for the abutment of the new Smoky Creek
Bridge. On a sanded track, rolling at thirty miles
an hour and screaming in the clutches of the
burning brakes, the heavy engines struck the switch
like an avalanche, reared upon the granite-laden
flats, and with forty loads of cattle plunged into
the canyon below; not a car remained on the rails.
The head brakeman, riding in the second cab, was
instantly killed, and the engine crews, who jumped,
were badly hurt.</p>
<p>The whole operating department of the road
was stirred. What made the affair more dreadful
was that it had occurred on the time of Number
Six, the east-bound passenger train, held that
morning at Sleepy Cat by an engine failure.
Glover came to look into the matter. The testimony
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
of all tended to one conclusion&ndash;&ndash;that the
quarry switch had been thrown at some time between
four-thirty and five o&#8217;clock that morning.
Inferences were many: tramps during the early
summer had been unusually troublesome and many
of them had been rigorously handled by trainmen;
robbery might have been a motive, as the express
cars on train Number Six carried heavy specie shipments
from the coast.</p>
<p>Yet a means so horrible as well as so awkward
and ineffective seemed unlike mountain outlaws.
Strange men from headquarters were on the
ground as soon as they could reach the wreck, men
from the special-service department, and a stock
inspector who greatly resembled Whispering
Smith was on the ground looking into the brands
of the wrecked cattle. Glover was much in consultation
with him, and there were two or three
of the division men, such as Anderson, Young, McCloud,
and Lee, who knew him but could answer
no inquiries concerning his long stay at the wreck.</p>
<p>A third and more exciting event soon put the
quarry wreck into the background. Ten days
afterward an east-bound passenger train was
flagged in the night at Sugar Buttes, twelve miles
west of Sleepy Cat. When the heavy train slowed
up, two men boarded the engine and with pistols
compelled the engineman to cut off the express
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
cars and pull them to the water-tank a mile
east of the station. Three men there in waiting
forced the express car, blew open the safe, and the
gang rode away half an hour later loaded with
gold coin and currency.</p>
<p>Had a stick of dynamite been exploded under
the Wickiup there could not have been more excitement
at Medicine Bend. Within three hours
after the news reached the town a posse under
Sheriff Van Horn, with a carload of horseflesh and
fourteen guns, was started for Sugar Buttes. The
trail led north and the pursuers rode until nearly
nightfall. They crossed Dutch Flat and rode
single file into a wooded canyon, where they came
upon traces of a camp-fire. Van Horn, leading,
jumped from his horse and thrust his hand into
the ashes; they were still warm, and he shouted to
his men to ride up. As he called out, a rifle
cracked from the box-elder trees ahead of him.
The sheriff fell, shot through the head, and a
deputy springing from his saddle to pick him up
was shot in precisely the same way, through the
head. The riderless horses bolted; the posse,
thrown into a panic, did not fire a shot, and for an
hour dared not ride back for the bodies. After
dark they got the two dead men and at midnight
rode with them into Sleepy Cat.</p>
<p>When the news reached McCloud he was talking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
with Bucks over the wires. Bucks had got into
headquarters at the river late that night, and was
getting details from McCloud of the Sugar Buttes
robbery when the superintendent sent him the news
of the killing of Van Horn and the deputy. In
the answer that Bucks sent came a name new to
the wires of the mountain division and rarely seen
even in special correspondence, but Hughie Morrison,
who took the message, never forgot that name;
indeed, it was soon to be thrown sharply into the
spotlight of the mountain railroad stage. Hughie
repeated the message to get it letter-perfect; to
handle stuff at the Wickiup signed &#8220;J. S. B.&#8221; was
like handling diamonds on a jeweller&#8217;s tongs or
arteries on a surgeon&#8217;s hook; and, in truth, Bucks&#8217;s
words were the arteries and pulse-beat of the
mountain division. Hughie handed the message
to McCloud and stood by while the superintendent
read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whispering Smith is due in Cheyenne to-morrow. Meet
him at the Wickiup Sunday morning; he has full authority. I
have told him to get these fellows, if it takes all the money in
the treasury, and not to stop till he cleans them out of the Rocky
Mountains. J. S. B.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>AT THE THREE HORSES</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Clean them out of the Rocky Mountains;
that is a pretty good contract,&#8221; mused the
man in McCloud&#8217;s office on Sunday morning. He
sat opposite McCloud in Bucks&#8217;s old easy chair and
held in his hand Bucks&#8217;s telegram. As he spoke
he raised his eyebrows and settled back, but the
unusual depth of the chair and the shortness of his
legs left his chin helpless in his black tie, so that
he was really no better off except that he had
changed one position of discomfort for another.
&#8220;I wonder, now,&#8221; he mused, sitting forward again
as McCloud watched him, &#8220;I wonder&ndash;&ndash;you know,
George, the Andes are, strictly speaking, a part of
the great North American chain&ndash;&ndash;whether Bucks
meant to include the South American ranges in that
message?&#8221; and a look of mildly good-natured
anticipation overspread his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose you wire him and find out,&#8221; suggested
McCloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, George, no! Bucks never was accurate
in geographical expressions. Besides, he is shifty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
and would probably cover his tracks by telling me
to report progress when I got to Panama.&#8221;</p>
<p>A clerk opened the outer office door. &#8220;Mr.
Dancing asks if he can see you, Mr. McCloud.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell him I am busy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill Dancing, close on the clerk&#8217;s heels, spoke for
himself. &#8220;I know it, Mr. McCloud, I know it!&#8221;
he interposed urgently, &#8220;but let me speak to you
just a moment.&#8221; Hat in hand, Bill, because no one
would knock him down to keep him out, pushed into
the room. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a plan,&#8221; he urged, &#8220;in
regards to getting these hold-ups.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How are you, Bill?&#8221; exclaimed the man in
the easy chair, jumping hastily to his feet and
shaking Dancing&#8217;s hand. Then quite as hastily
he sat down, crossed his knees violently, stared at
the giant lineman, and exclaimed, &#8220;Let&#8217;s have
it!&#8221;</p>
<p>Dancing looked at him in silence and with some
contempt. The trainmaster had broken in on the
superintendent for a moment and the two were
conferring in an undertone. &#8220;What might your
name be, mister?&#8221; growled Dancing, addressing
with some condescension the man in the easy chair.</p>
<p>The man waved his hand as if it were immaterial
and answered with a single word: &#8220;Forgotten!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Forgotten!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a blamed queer name&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On the contrary, it&#8217;s a very common name and
that is just the trouble: it&#8217;s forgotten.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want, Bill?&#8221; demanded McCloud,
turning to the lineman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this man all right?&#8221; asked Dancing, jerking
his thumb toward the easy chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t say; you&#8217;ll have to ask him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll save you that trouble, Bill, by saying that
if it&#8217;s for the good of the division I am all right.
Death to its enemies, damme, say I. Now go on,
William, and give us your plan in regards to getting
these hold-ups&ndash;&ndash;yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dancing looked from one man to the other, but
McCloud appeared preoccupied and his visitor
seemed wholly serious. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to take
too much on myself&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; Bill began, speaking to
McCloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;You look as if you could carry a fair-sized
load, William, provided it bore the right label,&#8221;
suggested the visitor, entirely amiable.</p>
<p>&#8220;&ndash;&ndash;But nobody has felt worse over this thing
and recent things&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Recent things,&#8221; echoed the easy chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;&ndash;&ndash;happening to the division that I have.
Now I know there&#8217;s been trouble on the division&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I think you are putting it too strong there,
Bill, but let it pass.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&ndash;&ndash;there&#8217;s been differences; misunderstandings
and differences. So I says to myself maybe something
might be done to get everybody together
and bury the differences, like this: Murray Sinclair
is in town; he feels bad over this thing,
like any railroad man would. He&#8217;s a mountain
man, quick as the quickest with a gun, a good
trailer, rides like a fiend, and can catch a streak of
sunshine travelling on a pass. Why not put him at
the head of a party to run &#8217;em down?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Run &#8217;em down,&#8221; nodded the stranger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Differences such as be or may be&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;May be&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Being discussed when he brings &#8217;em in dead
or alive, and not before. That&#8217;s what I said to
Murray Sinclair, and Murray Sinclair is ready for
to take hold this minute and do what he can if
he&#8217;s asked. I told him plain I could promise no
promises; that, I says, lays with George McCloud.
Was I right, was I wrong? If I was wrong, right
me; if I was right, say so. All I want is harmony.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new man nodded approval. &#8220;Bully, Bill!&#8221;
he exclaimed heartily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mister,&#8221; protested the lineman, with simple
dignity, &#8220;I&#8217;d just a little rather you wouldn&#8217;t bully
me nor Bill me.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></div>
<p>&#8220;All in good part, Bill, as you shall see; all in
good part. Now before Mr. McCloud gives you
his decision I want to be allowed a word. Your
idea looks good to me. At first I may say it
didn&#8217;t. I am candid; I say it didn&#8217;t. It looked
like setting a dog to catch his own tail. Mind you,
I don&#8217;t say it can&#8217;t be done. A dog <i>can</i> catch his
own tail; <i>they do do it</i>,&#8221; proclaimed the stranger
in a low and emphatic undertone. &#8220;But,&#8221; he added,
moderating his utterance, &#8220;when they succeed&ndash;&ndash;who
gets anything out of it but the dog?&#8221; Bill
Dancing, somewhat clouded and not deeming it
well to be drawn into any damaging admissions,
looked around for a cigar, and not seeing one,
looked solemnly at the new Solomon and stroked
his beard. &#8220;That is how it looked to me at
first,&#8221; concluded the orator; &#8220;<i>but</i>, I say now it
looks good to me, and as a stranger I may say I
favor it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dancing tried to look unconcerned and seemed
disposed to be friendly. &#8220;What might be your
line of business?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Real estate. I am from Chicago. I sold
everything that was for sale in Chicago and came
out here to stake out the Spanish Sinks and the
Great Salt Lake&ndash;&ndash;yes. It&#8217;s drying up and there&#8217;s
an immense opportunity for claims along the shore.
I&#8217;ve been looking into it.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Into the claims or into the lake?&#8221; asked McCloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Into both; and, Mr. McCloud, I want to
say I favor Mr. Dancing&#8217;s idea, that&#8217;s all. Right
wrongs no man. Let Bill see Sinclair and see what
they can figure out.&#8221; And having spoken, the
stranger sank back and tried to look comfortable.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll talk with you later about it, Bill,&#8221; said
McCloud briefly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meantime, Bill, see Sinclair and report,&#8221; suggested
the stranger.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s as good as done,&#8221; announced Dancing,
taking up his hat, &#8220;and, Mr. McCloud, might I
have a little advance for cigars and things?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cigars and ammunition&ndash;&ndash;of course. See
Sykes, William, see Sykes; if the office is closed
go to his house&ndash;&ndash;and see what will happen to
you&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; added the visitor in an aside, &#8220;and tell him
to telephone up to Mr. McCloud for instruction,&#8221;
he concluded unceremoniously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now why do you want to start Bill on a fool
business like that?&#8221; asked McCloud, as Bill Dancing
took long steps from the room toward the
office of Sykes, the cashier.</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t know me to-day, but he will to-morrow,&#8221;
said the stranger reflectively. &#8220;Gods,
what I&#8217;ve seen that man go through in the days of
the giants! Why, George, this will keep the boys
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
talking, and they have to do something. Spend
the money; the company is making it too fast anyway;
they moved twenty-two thousand cars one
day last week. Personally I&#8217;m glad to have a
little fun out of it; it will be hell pure and undefiled
long before we get through. This will be an easy
way of letting Sinclair know I am here. Bill will
report me confidentially to him as a suspicious
personage.&#8221;</p>
<p>To the astonishment of Sykes, the superintendent
confirmed over the telephone Dancing&#8217;s statement
that he was to draw some expense money. Bill
asked for twenty-five dollars. Sykes offered him
two, and Bill with some indignation accepted five.
He spent all of this in trying to find Sinclair, and
on the strength of his story to the boys borrowed
five dollars more to prosecute the search. At ten
o&#8217;clock that night he ran into Sinclair playing cards
in the big room above the Three Horses.</p>
<p>The Three Horses still rears its hospitable two-story
front in Fort Street, the only one of the Medicine
Bend gambling houses that goes back to the
days of &#8217;67; and it is the boast of its owners that
since the key was thrown away, thirty-nine years
ago, its doors have never been closed, night or day,
except once for two hours during the funeral of
Dave Hawk. Bill Dancing drew Sinclair from his
game and told him of the talk with McCloud,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
touching it up with natural enthusiasm. The
bridgeman took the news in high good humor and
slapped Dancing on the back. &#8220;Did you see
him alone, Bill?&#8221; asked Sinclair, with interest.
&#8220;Come over here, come along. I want you to
meet a good friend. Here, Harvey, shake hands
with Bill Dancing. Bill, this is old Harvey Du
Sang, meanest man in the mountains to his enemies
and the whitest to his friends&ndash;&ndash;eh, Harvey?&#8221;</p>
<p>Harvey seemed uncommunicative. Studying his
hand, he asked in a sour way whether it was a jackpot,
and upon being told that it was not, pushed
forward some chips and looked stupidly up&ndash;&ndash;though
Harvey was by no means stupid. &#8220;Proud
to know you, sir,&#8221; said Bill, bending frankly as he
put out his hand. &#8220;Proud to know any friend
of Murray Sinclair&#8217;s. What might be your
business?&#8221;</p>
<p>Again Du Sang appeared abstracted. He
looked up at the giant lineman, who, in spite of his
own size and strength, could have crushed him between
his fingers, and hitched his chair a little,
but got no further toward an answer and paid no
attention whatever to Bill&#8217;s extended hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cow business, Bill,&#8221; interposed Sinclair.
&#8220;Where? Why, up near the park, Bill, up near
the park. Bill is an old friend of mine, Harvey.
Shake hands with George Seagrue, Bill, and you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
know Henry Karg&ndash;&ndash;and old Stormy Gorman&ndash;&ndash;well,
I guess you know him too,&#8221; exclaimed Sinclair,
introducing the other players. &#8220;Look here
a minute, Harvey.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harvey, much against his inclination, was drawn
from the table and retired with Sinclair and Dancing
to an empty corner, where Dancing told his
story again. At the conclusion of it Harvey
rather snorted. Sinclair asked questions. &#8220;Was
anybody else there when you saw McCloud,
Bill?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One man,&#8221; answered Bill impressively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A stranger to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A stranger? What did he look like?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Slender man and kind of odd talking, with a
sandy mustache.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hear his name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He told me his name, but it&#8217;s skipped me, I
declare. He&#8217;s kind of dark-complected like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stranger, eh?&#8221; mused Du Sang; his eyes were
wandering over the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Slender man,&#8221; repeated Bill, &#8220;but I didn&#8217;t
take much notice of him. Said he was in the real-estate
business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the real-estate business? And did he sit
there while you talked this over with the college
guy?&#8221; muttered Du Sang.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span></div>
<p>&#8220;He is all right, boys, and he said you&#8217;d know
his name if I could speak it,&#8221; declared Bill.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look anything like that man standing with his
hands in his pockets over there by the wheel?&#8221;
asked Du Sang, turning his back carefully on a
new-comer as he made the suggestion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&ndash;&ndash;there? No! Yes, hold on, that&#8217;s
the man there now! Hold on, now!&#8221; urged Bill,
struggling with the excitement of ten hours and
ten dollars all in one day. &#8220;His name sounded
like Fogarty.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Dancing spoke, Sinclair&#8217;s eyes riveted on the
new face at the other side of the gambling-room.
&#8220;Fogarty, hell!&#8221; he exclaimed, starting. &#8220;Stand
right still, Du Sang; don&#8217;t look around. That
man is Whispering Smith.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>PARLEY</h3>
</div>
<p>It was recalled one evening not long ago at the
Wickiup that the affair with Sinclair had all
taken place within a period of two years, and that
practically all of the actors in the event had been
together and in friendly relation on a Thanksgiving
Day at the Dunning ranch not so very long
before the trouble began. Dicksie Dunning was
away at school at the time, and Lance Dunning
was celebrating with a riding and shooting fest and
a barbecue.</p>
<p>The whole country had been invited. Bucks
was in the mountains on an inspection trip, and Bill
Dancing drove him with a party of railroad men
over from Medicine Bend. The mountain men
for a hundred and fifty miles around were out.
Gene and Bob Johnson, from Oroville and the
Peace River, had come with their friends. From
Williams Cache there was not only a big delegation&ndash;&ndash;more
of one than was really desirable&ndash;&ndash;but
it was led by old John Rebstock himself. When
the invitation is general, lines cannot be too closely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
drawn. Not only was Lance Dunning something
of a sport himself, but on the Long Range it is
part of a stockman&#8217;s creed to be on good terms with
his neighbors. At a Thanksgiving Day barbecue
not even a mountain sheriff would ask questions,
and Ed Banks, though present, respected the holiday
truce. Cowboys rode that day in the roping
contest who were from Mission Creek and from
Two Feather River.</p>
<p>Among the railroad people were George McCloud,
Anderson, the assistant superintendent, Farrell
Kennedy, chief of the special service, and his
right-hand man, Bob Scott. In especial, Sinclair&#8217;s
presence at the barbecue was recalled. He had
some cronies with him from among his up-country
following, and was introducing his new bridge
foreman, Karg, afterward known as Flat Nose,
and George Seagrue, the Montana cowboy. Sinclair
fraternized that day with the Williams Cache
men, and it was remarked even then that though a
railroad man he appeared somewhat outside the
railroad circle. When the shooting matches were
announced a brown-eyed railroad man was asked to
enter. He had been out of the mountains for
some time and was a comparative stranger in the
gathering, but the Williams Cache men had not
forgotten him; Rebstock, especially, wanted to see
him shoot. While much of the time out of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
mountains on railroad business, he was known to
be closely in Bucks&#8217;s counsels, and as to the mountains
themselves, he was reputed to know them
better than Bucks or Glover himself knew them.
This was Whispering Smith; but, beyond a low-voiced
greeting or an expression of surprise at
meeting an old acquaintance, he avoided talk.
When urged to shoot he resisted all persuasion and
backed up his refusal by showing a bruise on his
trigger finger. He declined even to act as judge in
the contest, suggesting the sheriff, Ed Banks, for
that office.</p>
<p>The rifle matches were held in the hills above
the ranch-house, and in the contest between the
ranches, for which a sweepstakes had been arranged,
Sinclair entered Seagrue, who was then
working for him. Seagrue shot all the morning and
steadily held up the credit of the Frenchman Valley
Ranch against the field. Neither continued
shooting nor severe tests availed to upset Sinclair&#8217;s
entry, and riding back after the matches with the
prize purse in his pocket, Seagrue, who was tall,
light-haired, and perfectly built, made a new honor
for himself on a dare from Stormy Gorman, the
foreman of the Dunning ranch. Gorman, who
had ridden a race back with Sinclair, was at the
foot of the long hill, down which the crowd was
riding, when he stopped, yelled back at Seagrue,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
and, swinging his hat from his head, laid it on a
sloping rock beside the trail.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better not do that, Stormy,&#8221; said Sinclair.
&#8220;Seagrue will put a hole through it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gorman laughed jealously. &#8220;If he can hit it,
let him hit it.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the top of the hill Seagrue had dismounted
and was making ready to shoot. Whispering
Smith, at his side, had halted with the party, and
the cowboy knelt to adjust his sights. On his
knee he turned to Whispering Smith, whom he
seemed to know, with an abrupt question: &#8220;How
far do you call it?&#8221;</p>
<p>The answer was made without hesitation:
&#8220;Give it seven hundred and fifty yards, Seagrue.&#8221;</p>
<p>The cowboy made ready, brought his rifle to
his shoulder, and fired. The slug passed through
the crown of the hat, and a shower of splinters flying
back from the rock blew the felt into a sieve.
Gorman&#8217;s curiosity, as well as that of everybody
else, seemed satisfied, and, gaining the level ground,
the party broke into a helter-skelter race for the
revolver-shooting.</p>
<p>In this Sinclair himself had entered, and after
the early matches found only one troublesome contestant&ndash;&ndash;Du
Sang from the Cache, who was present
under Rebstock&#8217;s wing. After Sinclair and
Du Sang had tied in test after test at shooting out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
of the saddle, Whispering Smith, who lost sight of
nothing in the gun-play, called for a pack of cards,
stripped the aces from the deck, and had a little
conference with the judge. The two contestants,
Sinclair and Du Sang, were ordered back thirty-five
paces on their horses, and the railroad man,
walking over to the targets, held out between the
thumb and forefinger of his left hand the ace
of clubs. The man that should first spot the
pip out of the card was to take the prize, a
Cheyenne saddle. Sinclair shot, and his horse,
perfectly trained, stood like a statue. The card
flew from Smith&#8217;s hand, but the bullet had struck
the ace almost an inch above the pip, and a second
ace was held out for Du Sang. As he raised his
gun his horse moved. He spurred angrily, circled
quickly about, halted, and instantly fired. It was
not alone that his bullet cut the shoulder of the
club pip on the card: the whole movement, beginning
with the circling dash of the horse under
the spur, the sudden halt, and the instantly accurate
aim, raised a quick, approving yell for the new-comer.
The signal was given for Sinclair, and a
third ace went up. In the silence Sinclair, with
deliberate care, brought his gun down on the card,
fired, and cut the pip cleanly from the white field.
Du Sang was urged to shoot again, but his horse
annoyed him and he would not.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></div>
<p>With a little speech the prize was given by Ed
Banks to Sinclair. &#8220;Here&#8217;s hoping your gun will
never be trained on me, Murray,&#8221; smiled the
modest sheriff.</p>
<p>Sinclair responded in high humor. He had every
reason to feel good. His horses had won the running
races, and his crowd had the honors with the
guns. He turned on Du Sang, who sat close by
in the circle of horsemen, and, holding the big prize
out toward him on his knee, asked him to accept
it. &#8220;It&#8217;s yours by rights anyway, Du Sang,&#8221; declared
Sinclair. &#8220;You&#8217;re a whole lot better shot
than I am, every turn of the road. You&#8217;ve shot
all day from a nervous horse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not only would Sinclair not allow a refusal of
his gift, but, to make his generosity worth while,
he dispatched Flat Nose to the corral, and the
foreman rode back leading the pony that had
won the half-mile dash. Sinclair cinched the prize
saddle on the colt with his own hands, led the
beast to Du Sang, placed the bridle in his hand,
and bowed. &#8220;From a jay to a marksman,&#8221; he
said, saluting.</p>
<p>Du Sang, greatly embarrassed by the affair&ndash;&ndash;he
had curious pink eyes&ndash;&ndash;blinked and got away to
the stables. When Rebstock joined him the Williams
Cache party were saddling to go home. Du
Sang made no reference to his gift horse and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
saddle, but spoke of the man that had held the
target aces. &#8220;He must be a sucker!&#8221; declared
Du Sang, with an oath. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t do that for
any man on top of ground. Who is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That man?&#8221; wheezed Rebstock. &#8220;Never
have no dealings with him. He plays &#8217;most any
kind of a game. He&#8217;s always ready to play, and
holds aces most of the time. Don&#8217;t you remember
my telling about the man that got Chuck Williams
and hauled him out of the Cache on a buckboard?
That&#8217;s the man. Here, he give me this for you;
it&#8217;s your card.&#8221; Rebstock handed Du Sang the
target ace of clubs. &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you thank Murray
Sinclair, you mule?&#8221;</p>
<p>Du Sang, whose eyelashes were white, blinked
at the hole through the card, and looked around
as he rode back across the field for the man
that had held it; but Whispering Smith had disappeared.</p>
<p>He was at that moment walking past the barbecue
pit with George McCloud. &#8220;Rebstock
talks a great deal about your shooting, Gordon,&#8221;
said McCloud to his companion.</p>
<p>&#8220;He and I once had a little private match of
our own. It was on the Peace River, over a bunch
of steers. Since then we have got along very well,
though he has an exaggerated opinion of my ability.
Rebstock&#8217;s worst failing is his eyesight. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
bothers him in seeing brands. He&#8217;s liable to
brand a critter half a dozen times. That albino,
Du Sang, is a queer duck. Sinclair gave him a
fine horse. There they go.&#8221; The Cache riders
were running their horses and whooping across the
creek. &#8220;What a hand a State&#8217;s prison warden at
Fort City could draw out of that crowd, George!&#8221;
continued McCloud&#8217;s companion. &#8220;If the right
man should get busy with that bunch of horses Sinclair
has got together, and organize those up-country
fellows for mischief, wouldn&#8217;t it make things
hum on the mountain division for a while?&#8221;</p>
<p>McCloud did not meet the host, Lance Dunning,
that day, nor since the day of the barbecue had
Du Sang or Sinclair seen Whispering Smith until
the night Du Sang spotted him near the wheel in
the Three Horses. Du Sang at once drew out
of his game and left the room. Sinclair in the
meantime had undertaken a quarrelsome interview
with Whispering Smith.</p>
<p>&#8220;I supposed you knew I was here,&#8221; said Smith
to him amiably. &#8220;Of course I don&#8217;t travel in a
private car or carry a bill-board on my back, but I
haven&#8217;t been hiding.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The last time we talked,&#8221; returned Sinclair,
measuring words carefully, &#8220;you were going to
stay out of the mountains.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should have been glad to, Murray. Affairs
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
are in such shape on the division now that somebody
had to come, so they sent for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two men were sitting at a table. Whispering
Smith was cutting and leisurely mixing a pack
of cards.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, so far as I&#8217;m concerned, I&#8217;m out of it,&#8221;
Sinclair went on after a pause, &#8220;but, however that
may be, if you&#8217;re back here looking for trouble
there&#8217;s no reason, I guess, why you can&#8217;t find it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not it. I&#8217;m not here looking for
trouble; I&#8217;m here to fix this thing up. What do
you want?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m willing to do anything fair and right,&#8221; declared
Whispering Smith, raising his voice a little
above the hum of the rooms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fair and right is an old song.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And a good one to sing in this country just
now. I&#8217;ll do anything I can to adjust any grievance,
Murray. What do you want?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sinclair for a moment was silent, and his answer
made plain his unwillingness to speak at all.
&#8220;There never would have been a grievance if I&#8217;d
been treated like a white man.&#8221; His eyes burned
sullenly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been treated like a dog.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is not it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is it,&#8221; declared Sinclair savagely, &#8220;and
they&#8217;ll find it&#8217;s it.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Murray, I want to say only this&ndash;&ndash;only this to
make things clear. Bucks feels that he&#8217;s been
treated worse than a dog.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then let him put me back where I belong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a little late for that, Murray; a <i>little</i> late,&#8221;
said Smith gently. &#8220;Shouldn&#8217;t you rather take
good money and get off the division? Mind you,
I say good money, Murray&ndash;&ndash;and peace.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sinclair answered without the slightest hesitation:
&#8220;Not while that man McCloud is here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whispering Smith smiled. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got no authority
to kill McCloud.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are plenty of men in the mountains that
don&#8217;t need any.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But let&#8217;s start fair,&#8221; urged Whispering Smith
softly. He leaned forward with one finger extended
in confidence. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let us have any
misunderstanding on the start. Let McCloud
alone. If he is killed&ndash;&ndash;now I&#8217;m speaking fair and
open and making no threats, but I know how it
will come out&ndash;&ndash;there will be nothing but killing
here for six months. We will make just that memorandum
on McCloud. Now about the main question.
Every sensible man in the world wants
something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know men that have been going a long time
without what they wanted.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith flushed and nodded. &#8220;You needn&#8217;t have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
said that, but no matter. Every sensible man
wants something Murray. This is a big country.
There&#8217;s a World&#8217;s Fair running somewhere all the
time in it. Why not travel a little? What do you
want?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want my job, or I want a new superintendent
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just exactly the two things, and, by heavens!
the only two, I can&#8217;t manage. Come once more
and I&#8217;ll meet you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; Sinclair rose to his feet. &#8220;No&ndash;&ndash;damn
your money! This is my home. The high country
is my country; it&#8217;s where my friends are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s filled with your friends; I know that. But
don&#8217;t put your trust in your friends. They will
stay by you, I know; but once in a long while there
will be a false friend, Murray, one that will sell
you&ndash;&ndash;remember that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I stay.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whispering Smith looked up in admiration.
&#8220;I know you&#8217;re game. It isn&#8217;t necessary for me
to say that to you. But think of the fight you are
going into against this company. You can worry
them; you&#8217;ve done it. But a bronco might as well
try to buck a locomotive as for one man or six
or six hundred to win out in the way you are
playing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will look out for my friends; others&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; Sinclair
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
hitched his belt and paused, but Whispering
Smith, cutting and running the cards, gave no heed.
His eyes were fixed on the green cloth under his
fingers. &#8220;Others&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; repeated Sinclair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Others?&#8221; echoed Whispering Smith good-naturedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;May look out for themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, of course! Well, if this is the end
of it, I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will be sorry if you mix in a quarrel that
is none of yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Murray, I never had a quarrel with a
man in my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are pretty smooth, but you can&#8217;t drive me
out of this country. I know how well you&#8217;d like
to do it; and, take notice, there&#8217;s one trail you can&#8217;t
cross even if you stay here. I suppose you understand
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith felt his heart leap. He sat in his chair
turning the pack slowly, but with only one hand
now; the other hand was free. Sinclair eyed him
sidewise. Smith moistened his lips and when he
replied spoke slowly: &#8220;There is no need of dragging
any allusion to her into it. For that matter,
I told Bucks he should have sent any man but me.
If I&#8217;m in the way, Sinclair, if my presence here is
all that stands in the way, I&#8217;ll go back and stay
back as before, and send any one else you like or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
Bucks likes. Are you willing to say that I stand
in the way of a settlement?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sinclair sat down and put his hands on the table.
&#8220;No; your matter and mine is another affair. All
I want between you and me is fair and right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whispering Smith&#8217;s eyes were on the cards.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve always had it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then keep away from <i>her</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me what to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then don&#8217;t tell me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not telling you. You will do as you
please; so will I. I left here because Marion
asked me to. I am here now because I have been
sent here. It is in the course of my business. I
have my living to earn and my friends to protect.
Don&#8217;t dictate to me, because it would be
of no use.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you know now how to get into trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Every one knows that; few know how to keep
out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t lay your finger on me at any turn of
the road.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not if you behave yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you can&#8217;t bully me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely not. No hard feelings, Murray. I
came for a friendly talk, and if it&#8217;s all the same to
you I&#8217;ll watch this wheel awhile and then go over to
the Wickiup. I leave first&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s understood, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
hope&ndash;&ndash;and if your pink-eyed friend is waiting outside
tell him there is nothing doing, will you, Murray?
Who is the albino, by the way? You don&#8217;t
know him? I think I do. Fort City, if I remember.
Well, good-night, Murray.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was after twelve o&#8217;clock and the room had
filled up. Roulette-balls were dropping, and above
the faro-table the extra lights were on. The dealers,
fresh from supper, were putting things in order
for the long trick.</p>
<p>At the Wickiup Whispering Smith found McCloud
in the office signing letters. &#8220;I can do
nothing with him,&#8221; said Smith, drawing down a
window-shade before he seated himself to detail
his talk with Sinclair. &#8220;He wants a fight.&#8221;</p>
<p>McCloud put down his pen. &#8220;If I am the disturber
it would be better for me to get out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That would be hauling down the flag across
the whole division. It is too late for that. If he
didn&#8217;t centre the fight on you he would centre it
somewhere else. The whole question is, who is
going to run this division, Sinclair and his gang
or the company? and it is as easy to meet them on
one point as another. I know of no way of making
this kind of an affair pleasant. I am going to
do some riding, as I told you. Kennedy is working
up through the Deep Creek country, and has
three men with him. I shall ride toward the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
Cache and meet him somewhere near South Mission
Pass.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gordon, would it do any good to ask a few
questions?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask as many as you like, my dear boy, but
don&#8217;t be disappointed if I can&#8217;t answer them. I
can look wise, but I don&#8217;t know anything. You
know what we are up against. This fellow has
grown a tiger among the wolves, and he has turned
the pack loose on us. One thing I ask you to do.
Don&#8217;t expose yourself at night. Your life isn&#8217;t
worth a coupling-pin if you do.&#8221;</p>
<p>McCloud raised his hand. &#8220;Take care of
<i>your</i>self. If you are murdered in this fight I shall
know I got you in and that I am to blame.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And suppose you were?&#8221; Smith had risen
from his chair. He had few mannerisms, and recalling
the man the few times I have seen him,
the only impression he has left on me is that of
quiet and gentleness. &#8220;Suppose you were?&#8221; He
was resting one arm on top of McCloud&#8217;s desk.
&#8220;What of it? You have done for me up here
what I couldn&#8217;t do, George. You have been kind
to Marion when she hadn&#8217;t a friend near. You
have stood between him and her when I couldn&#8217;t
be here to do it, and when she didn&#8217;t want me to&ndash;&ndash;helped
her when I hadn&#8217;t the privilege of doing it.&#8221;
McCloud put up his hand in protest, but it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
unheeded. &#8220;How many times it has been in my
heart to kill that man. She knows it; she prays it
may never happen. That is why she stays here
and has kept me out of the mountains. She says
they would talk about her if I lived in the same
town, and I have stayed away.&#8221; He threw himself
back into the chair. &#8220;It&#8217;s going beyond both
of us now. I&#8217;ve kept the promise I made to her
to-day to do all in my power to settle this thing
without bloodshed. It will not be settled in that
way, George.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was he at Sugar Buttes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If not, his gang was there. The quick get-away,
the short turn on Van Horn, killing two men
to rattle the <i>posse</i>&ndash;&ndash;it all bears Sinclair&#8217;s ear-marks.
He has gone too far. He has piled up plunder
till he is reckless. He is crazy with greed and
insane with revenge. He thinks he can gallop
over this division and scare Bucks till he gets down
on his knees to him. Bucks will never do it. I
know him, and I tell you Bucks will never do it.
He is like that man in Washington: he will fight
it to the death. He would fight Sinclair if he had
to come up here and meet him single-handed, but,
he will never have to do it. He put you here,
George, to round that man up. This is the price
for your advancement, and you must pay it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is all right for me to pay it, but I don&#8217;t want
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
you to pay it. Will you have a care for yourself,
Gordon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You need never ask me to be careful,&#8221; Smith
went on. &#8220;That is my business. I asked you to
watch your window-shades at night, and when I
came in just now I found one up. It is you who
are likely to forget, and in this kind of a game a
man never forgets but once. I&#8217;ll lie down on the
Lincoln lounge, George.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get into the bed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I like the lounge, and I&#8217;m off early.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the private room of the superintendent, provided
as a sleeping apartment in the old headquarters
building many years before hotel facilities
reached Medicine Bend, stood the only curio the
Wickiup possessed&ndash;&ndash;the Lincoln lounge. When
the car that carried the remains of Abraham Lincoln
from Washington to Springfield was dismantled,
the Wickiup fell heir to one piece of its
elaborate furnishings, the lounge, and the lounge
still remains as an early-day relic. Whispering
Smith walked into the bedroom and disposed himself
in an incredibly short time. &#8220;I&#8217;ve borrowed
one of your pillows, George,&#8221; he called out
presently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take both.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></div>
<p>&#8220;One&#8217;s enough. I hope,&#8221; he went on, rolling
himself like a hen into the double blanket, &#8220;the
horse Kennedy has left me will be all right; he
got three from Bill Dancing. Bill Dancing,&#8221;
he snorted, driving his nose into the pillow as if
in final memorandum for the night, &#8220;he will get
himself killed if he fools around Sinclair too much
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>McCloud, under a light shaded above his desk,
opened a roll of blue-prints. He was going to
follow a construction gang up the Crawling Stone
in the morning and wanted to look over the surveys.
Whispering Smith, breathing regularly, lay
not far away. It was late when McCloud put
away his maps, entered the inner room, and looked
at his friend.</p>
<p>He lay like a boy asleep. On the chair beside
his head he had placed his old-fashioned hunting-case
watch, as big as an alarm-clock, the kind
a railroad man would wind up with a spike-maul.
Beside the watch he had laid his huge revolver
in its worn leather scabbard. Breathing
peacefully, he lay quite at his companion&#8217;s mercy,
and McCloud, looking down on this man who
never made a mistake, never forgot a danger, and
never took an unnecessary chance, thought of what
between men confidence may sometimes mean.
He sat a moment with folded arms on the side of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
his bed, studying the tired face, defenceless in the
slumber of fatigue. When he turned out the
light and lay down, he wondered whether, somewhere
in the valley of the great river to which
he was to take his men in the morning, he
should encounter the slight and reckless horsewoman
who had blazed so in anger when he
stood before her at Marion&#8217;s. He had struggled
against her charm too long. She had become,
how or when he could not tell, not alone a pretty
woman but a fascinating one&ndash;&ndash;the creature of his
constant thought. Already she meant more to
him than all else in the world. He well knew that
if called on to choose between Dicksie and all else
he could only choose her. But as he drew together
the curtains of thought and sleep stole in
upon him, he was resolved first to have Dicksie;
to have all else if he could, but, in any case, Dicksie
Dunning. When he awoke day was breaking
in the mountains. The huge silver watch, the low-voiced
man, and the formidable six-shooter had
disappeared. It was time to get up, and Marion
Sinclair had promised an early breakfast.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>THE TURN IN THE STORM</h3>
</div>
<p>The beginning of the Crawling Stone Line
marked the first determined effort under
President Bucks, while undertaking the reconstruction
of the system for through traffic, to develop
the rich local territory tributary to the mountain
division. New policies in construction dated from
the same period. Glover, with an enormous capital
staked for the new undertakings, gave orders to
push the building every month in the year, and for
the first time in mountain railroad-building winter
was to be ignored. The older mountain men
met the innovation as they met any departure from
their traditions, with curiosity and distrust. On the
other hand, the new and younger blood took hold
with confidence, and when Glover called, &#8220;Yo,
heave ho!&#8221; at headquarters, they bent themselves
clear across the system for a hard pull together.</p>
<p>McCloud, resting the operating on the shoulders
of his assistant Anderson, devoted himself wholly
to forwarding the construction plans, and his first
clash over winter road-building in the Rockies came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
with his own right-hand man, Mears. McCloud
put in a switch below Piedmont, opened a material-yard,
and began track-laying toward the lower
Crawling Stone Valley, when Mears said it was
time to stop work till spring. When McCloud
told him he wanted track across the divide and
into the lower valley by spring, Mears threw up
his hands. But there was metal in the old man,
and he was for orders all the time. He kept up
a running fire of protests and forebodings about
the danger of exposing men during the winter season,
but stuck to his post. Glover sent along the
men, and although two out of every three deserted
the day after they arrived, Mears kept a force in
hand, and crowded the track up the new grade as
fast as the ties and steel came in, working day in
and day out with one eye on the clouds and one on
the tie-line and hoping every day for orders to stop.</p>
<p>December slipped away to Christmas with the
steel still going down and the disaffected element
among the railroad men at Medicine Bend waiting
for disaster. The spectacle of McCloud handling
a flying column on the Crawling Stone work in the
face of the most treacherous weather in the mountain
year was one that brought out constant criticism
of him among Sinclair&#8217;s sympathizers and
friends, and while McCloud laughed and pushed
ahead on the work, they waited only for his discomfiture.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
Christmas Day found McCloud at the
front, with men still very scarce, but Mears&#8217;s gang
at work and laying steel. The work train was in
charge of Stevens, the freight conductor, who had
been set back after the Smoky Creek wreck and
was slowly climbing back to position. They were
working in the usual way, with the flat cars ahead
pushed by the engine, the caboose coupled to the
tender being on the extreme hind end of the train.</p>
<p>At two o&#8217;clock on Christmas afternoon, when
there was not a cloud in the sky, the horizon thickened
in the east. Within thirty minutes the mountains
from end to end of the sky-line were lost in
the sweep of a coming wind, and at three o&#8217;clock
snow struck the valley like a pall. Mears, greatly
disturbed, ordered the men off the grade and into
the caboose. McCloud had been inspecting culverts
ahead, and had started for the train when the
snow drove across the valley. It blotted the landscape
from sight so fast that he was glad after an
anxious five minutes to regain the ties and find
himself safely with his men.</p>
<p>But when McCloud came in the men were bordering
on a panic. Mears, with his two foremen,
had gone ahead to hunt McCloud up, and had
passed him in the storm; it was already impossible
to see, or to hear an ordinary sound ten yards away.
McCloud ordered the flat cars cut off the train and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
the engine whistle sounded at short intervals, and,
taking Stevens, buttoned his reefer and started
up the grade after the three trackmen. They fired
their revolvers as they went on, but the storm
tossed their signals on the ears of Mears and his
companions from every quarter of the compass.
McCloud was standing on the last tie and planning
with his companion how best to keep the grade as
the two advanced, when the engine signals suddenly
changed. &#8220;Now that sounds like one of
Bill Dancing&#8217;s games,&#8221; said McCloud to his companion.
&#8220;What the deuce is it, Stevens?&#8221;</p>
<p>Stevens, who knew a little of everything, recognized
the signals in an instant and threw up his
hands. &#8220;It&#8217;s Morse code, Mr. McCloud, and
they are in&ndash;&ndash;Mears and the foremen&ndash;&ndash;and us for
the train as quick as the Lord will let us; that&#8217;s
what they&#8217;re whistling.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So much for an education, Stevens. Bully for
you! Come on!&#8221;</p>
<p>They regained the flat cars and made their way
back to the caboose and engine, which stood uncoupled.
McCloud got into the cab with Dancing
and Stevens. Mears, from the caboose
ahead, signalled all in, and, with a whistling
scream, the engine started to back the caboose
to Piedmont. They had hardly more than got
under full headway when a difficulty became apparent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
to the little group around the superintendent.
They were riding an unballasted track
and using such speed as they dared to escape from
a situation that had become perilous. But the light
caboose, packed like a sardine-box with men, was
dancing a hornpipe on the rail-joints. McCloud
felt the peril, and the lurching of the car could be
seen in the jerk of the engine tender to which it
was coupled. Apprehensive, he crawled back on
the coal to watch the caboose himself, and stayed
long enough to see that the rapidly drifting snow
threatened to derail the outfit any minute. He
got back to the cab and ordered a stop. &#8220;This
won&#8217;t do!&#8221; said he to Stevens and the engineman.
&#8220;We can&#8217;t back that caboose loaded with men
through this storm. We shall be off the track in
five minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Try it slow,&#8221; suggested Stevens.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we had the time,&#8221; returned McCloud; &#8220;but
the snow is drifting on us. We&#8217;ve got to make a
run for it if we ever get back, and we must have
the engine in front of that way car with her pilot
headed for the drifts. Let&#8217;s look at things.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dancing and Stevens, followed by McCloud,
dropped out of the gangway. Mears opened the
caboose door and the four men went forward to
inspect the track and the trucks. In the lee of the
caboose a council was held. The roar of the wind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
was like the surge of many waters, and the snow
had whitened into storm. They were ten miles from
a habitation, and, but for the single track they
were travelling, might as well have been a hundred
miles so far as reaching a place of safety was concerned.
They were without food, with a caboose
packed with men on their hands, and they realized
that their supply of fuel for either engine or
caboose was perilously slender.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get your men ready with their tools, Pat,&#8221;
said McCloud to Mears.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to turn the train around and put
the nose of the engine into it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Turn the train around&ndash;&ndash;why, yes, that would
make it easy. I&#8217;d be glad to see it turned around.
But where&#8217;s your turntable, Mr. McCloud?&#8221;
asked Mears.</p>
<p>&#8220;How are you going to turn your train around
on a single track?&#8221; asked Stevens darkly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to turn the track around. I know
about where we are, I think. There&#8217;s a little stretch
just beyond this curve where the grade is flush
with the ground. Ask your engineman to run back
very slowly and watch for the bell-rope. I&#8217;ll ride
on the front platform of the caboose till we get
to where we want to go to work. Lose no time,
Pat; tell your men it&#8217;s now or never. If we are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
caught here we may stay till they carry us home,
and the success of this little game depends on
having everything ready and working quick.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stevens, who stayed close to McCloud, pulled
the cord within five minutes, and before the caboose
had stopped the men were tumbling out of it. McCloud
led Mears and his foreman up the track.
They tramped a hundred yards back and forth,
and, with steel tapes for safety lines, swung a hundred
feet out on each side of the track to make
sure of the ground. &#8220;This will do,&#8221; announced
McCloud; &#8220;you waited here half a day for steel
a week ago; I know the ground. Break that joint,
Pat.&#8221; He pointed to the rail under his foot.
&#8220;Pass ahead with the engine and car about a thousand
feet,&#8221; he said to the conductor, &#8220;and when I
give you a signal back up slow and look out for a
thirty-degree curve&ndash;&ndash;without any elevation, either.
Get out all your men with lining-bars.&#8221;</p>
<p>The engine and caboose faded in the blur of the
blizzard as the break was made in the track.
&#8220;Take those bars and divide your men into batches
of ten with foremen that can make signs, if they
can&#8217;t talk English,&#8221; directed McCloud. &#8220;Work
lively now, and throw this track to the south!&#8221;</p>
<p>Pretty much everybody&ndash;&ndash;Japs, Italians, and
Greeks&ndash;&ndash;understood the game they were playing.
McCloud said afterward he would match his Piedmont
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
hundred in making a movable Y against
any two hundred experts Glover could pick; they
had had the experience, he added, when the move
meant their last counter in the game of mountain
life or death. The Piedmont &#8220;hundred,&#8221; to McCloud&#8217;s
mind, were after that day past masters in
the art of track-shifting. Working in a driving
cloud of grit and snow, the ignorant, the dull, and
the slow rose to the occasion. Bill Dancing, Pat
Mears and his foreman, and Stevens moved about
in the driving snow like giants. The howling storm
rang with the shouting of the foremen, the guttural
cries of the Japs, and the clank of the lining-bars
as rail-length after rail-length of the heavy track
was slued bodily from the grade alignment and
swung around in a short curve to a right angle
out on the open ground.</p>
<p>McCloud at last gave the awaited signal, and,
with keen-eyed, anxious men watching every revolution
of the cautious driving-wheels, the engine,
hissing and pausing as the air-brakes went off and
on, pushed the light caboose slowly out on the rough
spur to its extreme end and stopped with the pilot
facing the main track at right angles; but before it
had reached its halting-place spike-mauls were
ringing at the fish-plates where a moment before
it had left the line on the curve. The track at
that point was cut again, and under a long line of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
bars and a renewed shouting it was thrown gradually
quite across the long gap in the main line, and
the new joints in a very rough curve were made fast
just as the engine, running now with its pilot ahead,
steamed slowly around the new curve and without
accident regained the regular grade. It was
greeted by a screeching yell as the men climbed
into the caboose, for the engine stood safely headed
into the teeth of the storm for Piedmont. The
ten miles to cover were now a matter of less than
thirty minutes, and the construction train drew into
the Piedmont yards just as the telegraph wires were
heating from headquarters with orders annulling
freights, ordering ploughs on outgoing engines,
and battening the division hatches for a grapple
with a Christmas blizzard.</p>
<p>No man came back better pleased than Stevens.
&#8220;That man is all right,&#8221; said he to Mears, nodding
his head toward McCloud, as they walked up
from the caboose. &#8220;That&#8217;s all I want to say.
Some of these fellows have been a little shy about
going out with him; they&#8217;ve hounded me for
months about stepping over his way when Sinclair
and his mugs struck. I reckon I played my hand
about right.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>THE QUARREL</h3>
</div>
<p>Spring found the construction of the valley
line well advanced, and the grades nearing
the lands of the Dunning ranch. Right-of-way
men had been working for months with Lance
Dunning, over the line, and McCloud had been
called frequently into consultation to adjust the
surveys to objections raised by Dicksie&#8217;s cousin to
the crossing of the ranch lands. Even when the
proceedings had been closed, a strong current of
discontent set from the managing head of the
Stone Ranch. Rumors of Lance Dunning&#8217;s dissatisfaction
often reached the railroad people. Vague
talk of an extensive irrigation scheme planned by
Sinclair for the Crawling Stone Valley crept into
the newspapers, and it was generally understood
that Lance Dunning had expressed himself favorably
to the enterprise.</p>
<p>Dicksie gave slight heed to matters as weighty
as these. She spent much of her time on horseback,
with Jim under the saddle; and in Medicine
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
Bend, where she rode with frequency, Marion&#8217;s
shop became her favorite abiding-place. Dicksie
ordered hats until Marion&#8217;s conscience rose and she
practically refused to supply any more. But the
spirited controversy on this point, as on many
others&ndash;&ndash;Dicksie&#8217;s haughtiness and Marion&#8217;s restraint,
quite unmoved by any show of displeasure&ndash;&ndash;ended
always in drawing the two closer to each
other.</p>
<p>At home Dicksie&#8217;s fancies at that time ran to
chickens, and crate after crate of thoroughbreds
and clutch after clutch of eggs were brought over
the pass from far-away countries. But the coyotes
stole the chickens and kept the hens in such a state
of excitement that they could not be got to sit
effectively. Nest after nest Dicksie had the mortification
of seeing deserted at critical moments
and left to furred prowlers of the foothills and
canyons. Once she had managed to shoot a particularly
bold coyote, only to be overcome with
remorse at seeing its death-struggle. She gained
reputation with her cousin and the men, but was
ever afterward assailed with the reflection that the
poor fellow might have been providing for a hungry
family. Housekeeping cares rested lightly on
Dicksie. Puss had charge of the house, and her
mistress concerned herself more with the setting
of Jim&#8217;s shoes than with the dust on the elk heads
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
over the fireplace in the dining-room. Her Medicine
Bend horseshoer stood in much greater awe of
her than Puss did, because if he ever left a mistake
on Jim&#8217;s heels Dicksie could, and would,
point it coldly out.</p>
<p>One March afternoon, coming home from
Medicine Bend, she saw at some distance before
her a party of men on horseback. She was riding
a trail leading from the pass road that followed
the hills, and the party was coming up the bridge
road from the lower ranch. Dicksie had good
eyes, and something unusual in the riding of the
men was soon apparent to her. Losing and regaining
sight of them at different turns in the trail,
she made out, as she rode among the trees, that
they were cowboys of her own ranch, and riding,
under evident excitement, about a strange horseman.
She recognized in the escort Stormy Gorman,
the ferocious foreman of the ranch, and Denison
and Jim Baugh, two of the most reckless of
the men. These three carried rifles slung across
their pommels, and in front of them rode the
stranger.</p>
<p>Fragments of the breakfast-table talk of the
morning came back to Dicksie&#8217;s mind. The railroad
graders were in the valley below the ranch,
and she had heard her cousin say a good deal on
a point she cared little about, as to where the railroad
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
should cross the Stone Ranch. Approaching
the fork of the two roads toward which she and the
cowboys were riding, she checked her horse in the
shade of a cottonwood tree, and as the party rode
up the draw she saw the horseman under surveillance.
It was George McCloud.</p>
<p>Unluckily, as she caught a glimpse of him she
was conscious that he was looking at her. She
bent forward to hide a momentary confusion,
spoke briskly to her horse, and rode out of sight.
At Marion&#8217;s she had carefully avoided him. Her
precipitancy at their last meeting had seemed, on
reflection, unfortunate. She felt that she must have
appeared to him shockingly rude, and there was
in her recalling of the scene an unconfessed impression
that she had been to blame. Often when Marion
spoke of him, which she did without the slightest
reserve and with no reference as to whether
Dicksie liked it or not, it had been in Dicksie&#8217;s
mind to bring up the subject of the disagreeable
scene, hoping that Marion would suggest a way
for making some kind of unembarrassing amends.
But such opportunities had slipped away unimproved,
and here was the new railroad superintendent,
whom their bluff neighbor Sinclair never referred
to other than as the college guy, being
brought apparently as a prisoner to the Stone
Ranch.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span></div>
<p>Busied with her thoughts, Dicksie rode slowly
along the upper trails until a long <i>d&eacute;tour</i> brought
her around the corrals and in at the back of the
house. Throwing her lines to the ground, she
alighted and through the back porch door made
her way unobserved to her room. From the office
across the big hall she heard men&#8217;s voices in dispute,
and she slipped into the dining-room, where she
could hear and might see without being seen. The
office was filled with cowboys. Lance Dunning,
standing with a cigar in his hand and one leg
thrown over a corner of the table, was facing McCloud,
who stood before him with his hand on a
chair. Lance was speaking as Dicksie looked into
the room, and in curt tones: &#8220;My men were acting
under my orders.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have no right to give such orders,&#8221; McCloud
said distinctly, &#8220;nor to detain me, nor to
obstruct our free passage along the right of way
you have agreed to convey to us under our survey.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn your survey! I never had a plat of any
such survey. I don&#8217;t recognize any such survey.
And if your right-of-way men had ever said a word
about crossing the creek above the flume I never
would have given you a right of way at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There were never but two lines run below the
creek; after you raised objection I ran them both,
and both were above the flume.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Well, you can&#8217;t put a grade there. I and some
of my neighbors are going to dam up that basin,
and the irrigation laws will protect our rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly can&#8217;t put a grade in below the flume,
and you refuse to talk about our crossing above it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not let us cross where we are, and run a
new level for your ditch that will put the flume
higher up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will have to cross below the flume where
it stands, or you won&#8217;t cross the ranch at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>McCloud was silent for a moment. &#8220;I am
using a supported grade there for eight miles to
get over the hill within a three-tenths limit. I
can&#8217;t drop back there. We might as well not build
at all if we can&#8217;t hold our grade, whereas it would
be very simple to run a new line for your ditch,
and my engineers will do it for you without a dollar
of expense to you, Mr. Dunning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lance Dunning waved his hand as an ultimatum.
&#8220;Cross where I tell you to cross, or keep off the
Stone Ranch. Is that English?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly is. But in matter of fact we must
cross on the survey agreed on in the contract for
a right-of-way deed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t recognize any contract obtained under
false representations.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you accuse me of false representations?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></div>
<p>Lance Dunning flipped the ash from his cigar.
&#8220;Who are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am just a plain, every-day civil engineer, but
you must not talk false representations in any contract
drawn under my hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am talking facts. Whispering Smith may
have rigged the joker&ndash;&ndash;I don&#8217;t know. Whoever
rigged it, it has been rigged all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Any charge against Whispering Smith is a
charge against me. He is not here to defend himself,
but he needs no defence. You have charged
me already with misleading surveys. I was telephoned
for this morning to come over to see
why you had held up our work, and your men
cover me with rifles while I am riding on a
public road.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have been warned, or your men have, to
keep off this ranch. Your man Stevens cut our
wires this morning&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As he had a perfect right to do on our right
of way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you think so, stranger, go ahead again!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no! We won&#8217;t have civil war&ndash;&ndash;not right
away, at least. And if you and your men have
threatened and browbeaten me enough for to-day,
I will go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t set foot on the Stone Ranch again, and
don&#8217;t send any men here to trespass, mark you!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I mark you perfectly. I did not set foot willingly
on your ranch to-day. I was dragged on it.
Where the men are grading now, they will finish
their work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, they won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What, would you drive us off land you have
already deeded?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The first man that cuts our wires or orders
them cut where they were strung yesterday will
get into trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then don&#8217;t string any wires on land that belongs
to us, for they will certainly come down if
you do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lance Dunning turned in a passion. &#8220;I&#8217;ll put
a bullet through you if you touch a barb of Stone
Ranch wire!&#8221;</p>
<p>Stormy Gorman jumped forward with his hand
covering the grip of his six-shooter. &#8220;Yes, damn
you, and I&#8217;ll put another!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cousin Lance!&#8221; Dicksie Dunning advanced
swiftly into the room. &#8220;You are under our own
roof, and you are wrong to talk in that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her cousin stared at her. &#8220;Dicksie, this is no
place for you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is when my cousin is in danger of forgetting
he is a gentleman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are interfering with what you know nothing
about!&#8221; exclaimed Lance angrily.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I know what is due to every one under this
roof.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you be good enough to leave this room?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not if there is to be any shooting or threats
of shooting that involve my cousin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dicksie, leave the room!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a hush. The cowboys dropped back.
Dicksie stood motionless. She gave no sign in her
manner that she heard the words, but she looked
very steadily at her cousin. &#8220;You forget yourself!&#8221;
was all she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am master here!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Also my cousin,&#8221; murmured Dicksie evenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t understand this matter at all!&#8221; declared
Lance Dunning vehemently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing could justify your language.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think I am going to allow this railroad
company to ruin this ranch while I am responsible
here? You have no business interfering, I say!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I have.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;These matters are not of your affair!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not of my affair?&#8221; The listeners stood
riveted. McCloud felt himself swallowing, and
took a step backward with an effort as Dicksie
advanced. Her hair, loosened by her ride,
spread low upon her head. She stood in her saddle
habit, with her quirt still in hand. &#8220;Any
affair that may lead my cousin into shooting is my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
affair. I make it mine. This is my father&#8217;s roof.
I neither know nor care anything about what led
to this quarrel, but the quarrel is mine now. I
will not allow my cousin to plunge into anything
that may cost him his life or ruin it.&#8221; She turned
suddenly, and her eyes fell on McCloud. &#8220;I am
not willing to leave either myself or my cousin in
a false position. I regret especially that Mr. McCloud
should be brought into so unpleasant a
scene, because he has already suffered rudeness at
my own hands&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>McCloud flushed. He raised his hand slightly.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I am very sorry for it,&#8221; added Dicksie,
before he could speak. Then, turning, she withdrew
from the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure,&#8221; said McCloud slowly, as he spoke
again to her cousin, &#8220;there need be no serious controversy
over the right-of-way matter, Mr. Dunning.
I certainly shall not precipitate any. Suppose
you give me a chance to ride over the ground
with you again and let us see whether we can&#8217;t
arrive at some conclusion?&#8221;</p>
<p>But Lance was angry, and nursed his wrath a
long time.

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>THE SHOT IN THE PASS</h3>
</div>
<p>Dicksie walked hurriedly through the dining-room
and out upon the rear porch.
Her horse was standing where she had left him.
Her heart beat furiously as she caught up the reins,
but she sprang into the saddle and rode rapidly
away. The flood of her temper had brought a
disregard of consequence: it was in the glow of
her eyes, the lines of her lips, and the tremor of
her nostrils as she breathed long and deeply on her
flying horse.</p>
<p>When she checked Jim she had ridden miles,
but not without a course nor without a purpose.
Where the roads ahead of her parted to lead down
the river and over the Elbow Pass to Medicine
Bend, she halted within a clump of trees almost
where she had first seen McCloud. Beyond the
Mission Mountains the sun was setting in a fire
like that which glowed under her eyes. She
could have counted her heart-beats as the crimson
ball sank below the verge of the horizon and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
shadows threw up the silver thread of the big river
and deepened across the heavy green of the alfalfa
fields. Where Dicksie sat, struggling with her
bounding pulse and holding Jim tightly in, no one
from the ranch or, indeed, from the up-country
could pass her unseen. She was waiting for a
horseman, and the sun had set but a few minutes
when she heard a sharp gallop coming down the
upper road from the hills.</p>
<p>All her brave plans, terror-stricken at the sound
of the hoof-beats, fled from her utterly. She was
stunned by the suddenness of the crisis. She had
meant to stop McCloud and speak to him, but
before she could summon her courage a tall, slender
man on horseback dashed past within a few
feet of her. She could almost have touched him
as he flew by, and a horse less steady than Jim
would have shied under her. Dicksie caught her
breath. She did not know this man&ndash;&ndash;she had seen
only his eyes, oddly bright in the twilight as he
passed&ndash;&ndash;but he was not of the ranch. He must
have come from the hill road, she concluded, down
which she herself had just ridden. He was somewhere
from the North, for he sat his horse like a
statue and rode like the wind.</p>
<p>But the encounter nerved her to her resolve.
Some leaden moments passed, and McCloud, galloping
at a far milder pace toward the fork of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
roads, checked his speed as he approached. He
saw a woman on horseback waiting in his path.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. McCloud!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Dunning!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I could not forgive myself if I waited too long
to warn you that threats have been made against
your life. Not of the kind you heard to-day. My
cousin is not a murderer, and never could be, I
am sure, in spite of his talk; but I was frightened
at the thought that if anything dreadful should
happen his name would be brought into it. There
are enemies of yours in this country to be feared,
and it is against these that I warn you. Good-night!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely you won&#8217;t ride away without giving
me a chance to thank you!&#8221; exclaimed McCloud.
Dicksie checked her horse. &#8220;I owe you a double
debt of gratitude,&#8221; he added, &#8220;and I am anxious
to assure you that we desire nothing that will injure
your interests in any way in crossing your lands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know nothing about those matters, because
my cousin manages everything. It is growing
late and you have a good way to go, so good-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you will allow me to ride back to the house
with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, indeed, thank you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will soon be dark and you are alone.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span></div>
<p>&#8220;No, no! I am quite safe and I have only a
short ride. It is you who have far to go,&#8221; and she
spoke again to Jim, who started briskly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Dunning, won&#8217;t you listen just a moment?
Please don&#8217;t run away!&#8221; McCloud was
trying to come up with her. &#8220;Won&#8217;t you hear
me a moment? I have suffered some little humiliation
to-day; I should really rather be shot up
than have more put on me. I am a man and
you are a woman, and it is already dark. Isn&#8217;t it
for me to see you safely to the house? Won&#8217;t
you at least pretend I can act as an escort and let
me go with you? I should make a poor figure trying
to catch you on horseback&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Dicksie nodded na&iuml;vely. &#8220;With that horse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With any horse&ndash;&ndash;I know that,&#8221; said McCloud,
keeping at her side.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I <i>can&#8217;t</i> let you ride back with me,&#8221; declared
Dicksie, urging Jim and looking directly
at McCloud for the first time. &#8220;How could I
explain?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me explain. I am famous for explaining,&#8221;
urged McCloud, spurring too.</p>
<p>&#8220;And will you tell me what <i>I</i> should be doing
while you were explaining?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps getting ready a first aid for the injured.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel as if I ought to run away,&#8221; declared
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
Dicksie, since she had clearly decided not to. &#8220;It
will have to be a compromise, I suppose. You
must not ride farther than the first gate, and let
us take this trail instead of the road. Now make
your horse go as fast as you can and I&#8217;ll keep
up.&#8221;</p>
<p>But McCloud&#8217;s horse, though not a wonder,
went too fast to suit his rider, who divided his
efforts between checking him and keeping up the
conversation. When McCloud dismounted to open
Dicksie&#8217;s gate, and stood in the twilight with his
hat in his hand and his bridle over his arm, he was
telling a story about Marion Sinclair, and Dicksie
in the saddle, tapping her knee with her bridle-rein,
was looking down and past him as if the light upon
his face were too bright. Before she would start
away she made him remount, and he said good-by
only after half a promise from her that she would
show him sometime a trail to the top of Bridger&#8217;s
Peak, with a view of the Peace River on the
east and the whole Mission Range and the park
country on the north. Then she rode away at an
amazing run, nodding back as he sat still holding
his hat above his head.</p>
<p>McCloud galloped toward the pass with one determination&ndash;&ndash;that
he would have a horse, and a
good one, one that could travel with Jim, if it cost
him his salary. He exulted as he rode, for the day
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
had brought him everything he wished, and humiliation
had been swallowed up in triumph. It was
nearly dark when he reached the crest between the
hills. At this point the southern grade of the pass
winds sharply, whence its name, the Elbow; but
from the head of the pass the grade may be commanded
at intervals for half a mile. Trotting down
this road with his head in a whirl of excitement,
McCloud heard the crack of a rifle; at the same instant
he felt a sharp slap at his hat. Instinct works
on all brave men very much alike. McCloud
dropped forward in his saddle, and, seeking no explanation,
laid his head low and spurred Bill Dancing&#8217;s
horse for life or death. The horse, quite
amazed, bolted and swerved down the grade like a
snipe, with his rider crouching close for a second
shot. But no second shot came, and after another
mile McCloud ventured to take off his hat and put
his finger through the holes in it, though he did not
stop his horse to make the examination. When
they reached the open country the horse had
settled into a fast, long stride that not only redeemed
his reputation but relieved his rider&#8217;s
nerves.</p>
<p>When McCloud entered his office it was half-past
nine o&#8217;clock, and the first thing he did before
turning on the lights was to draw the window-shades.
He examined the hat again, with sensations
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
that were new to him&ndash;&ndash;fear, resentment, and
a hearty hatred of his enemies. But all the while
the picture of Dicksie remained. He thought of
her nodding to him as they parted in the saddle,
and her picture blotted out all that had followed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>AT THE WICKIUP</h3>
</div>
<p>Two nights later Whispering Smith rode into
Medicine Bend. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been up around
Williams Cache,&#8221; he said, answering McCloud&#8217;s
greeting as he entered the upstairs office. &#8220;How
goes it?&#8221; He was in his riding rig, just as he
had come from a late supper.</p>
<p>When he asked for news McCloud told him the
story of the trouble with Lance Dunning over the
survey, and added that he had referred the matter
to Glover. He told then of his unpleasant surprise
when riding home afterward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; assented Smith, looking with feverish
interest at McCloud&#8217;s head; &#8220;I heard about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s odd, for I haven&#8217;t said a word about
the matter to anybody but Marion Sinclair, and
you haven&#8217;t seen her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard up the country. It is great luck that
he missed you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who missed me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The man that was after you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The bullet went through my hat.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Let me see the hat.&#8221;</p>
<p>McCloud produced it. It was a heavy, broad-brimmed
Stetson, with a bullet-hole cut cleanly
through the front and the back of the crown.
Smith made McCloud put the hat on and describe
his position when the shot was fired. McCloud
stood up, and Whispering Smith eyed him and put
questions.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think of it?&#8221; asked McCloud
when he had done.</p>
<p>Smith leaned forward on the table and pushed
McCloud&#8217;s hat toward him as if the incident were
closed. &#8220;There is no question in my mind, and
there never has been, but that Stetson puts up the
best hat worn on the range.&#8221;</p>
<p>McCloud raised his eyebrows. &#8220;Why, thank
you! Your conclusion clears things so. After you
speak a man has nothing to do but guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, by Heaven, George,&#8221; exclaimed Smith,
speaking with unaccustomed fervor, &#8220;Miss Dicksie
Dunning is a hummer, <i>isn&#8217;t</i> she? That child
will have the whole range going in another year.
To think of her standing up and lashing her cousin
in that way when he was browbeating a railroad
man!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you hear about that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The whole Crawling Stone country is talking
about it. You never told me you had a misunderstanding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
with Dicksie Dunning at Marion&#8217;s.
Loosen up!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will loosen up in the way you do. What
scared me most, Gordon, was waiting for the second
shot. Why didn&#8217;t he fire again?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Doubtless he thought he had you the first
time. Any man big enough to start after you is
not used to shooting twice at two hundred and
fifty yards. He probably thought you were falling
out of the saddle; and it was dark. I can account
for everything but your reaching the pass so late.
How did you spend all your time between the
ranch and the foothills?&#8221;</p>
<p>McCloud saw there was no escape from telling
of his meeting with Dicksie Dunning, of her
warning, and of his ride to the gate with her.
Every point brought a suppressed exclamation from
Whispering Smith. &#8220;So she gave you your life,&#8221;
he mused. &#8220;Good for her! If you had got into
the pass on time you could not have got away&ndash;&ndash;the
cards were stacked for you. He overestimated you
a little, George; just a little. Good men make
mistakes. The sport of circumstances that we are!
The sport of circumstances!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now tell me how <i>you</i> heard so much about it,
Gordon, and where?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Through a friend, but forget it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know who shot at me?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I do, too. I think it was the fellow
that shot so well with the rifle at the barbecue&ndash;&ndash;what
was his name? He was working for Sinclair,
and perhaps is yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean Seagrue, the Montana cowboy?
No, you are wrong. Seagrue is a man-killer, but
a square one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will tell you sometime&ndash;&ndash;but this was not
Seagrue.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One of Dunning&#8217;s men, was it? Stormy
Gorman?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, a very different sort! Stormy is a
wind-bag. The man that is after you is in town
at this minute, and he has come to stay until he
finishes his job.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The devil! That&#8217;s what makes your eyes so
bright, is it? Do you know him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have seen him. You may see him yourself
if you want to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like nothing better. When?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To-night&ndash;&ndash;in thirty minutes.&#8221; McCloud
closed his desk. There was a rap at the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;That must be Kennedy,&#8221; said Smith. &#8220;I
haven&#8217;t seen him, but I sent word for him to meet
me here.&#8221; The door opened and Kennedy entered
the room.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Sit down, Farrell,&#8221; said Whispering Smith
easily. &#8220;<i>Ve gates?</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Wie geht es?</i> Don&#8217;t pretend you can&#8217;t make
out my German. He is trying to let on he is
not a Dutchman,&#8221; observed Whispering Smith
to McCloud. &#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t believe it, but I
can remember when Farrell wore wooden shoes
and lighted his pipe with a candle. He sleeps
under a feather-bed yet. Du Sang is in town,
Farrell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Du Sang!&#8221; echoed the tall man with mild interest
as he picked up a ruler and, throwing his leg
on the edge of the table, looked cheerful. &#8220;How
long has Du Sang been in town? Visiting friends
or doing business?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is after your superintendent. He has been
here since four o&#8217;clock, I reckon, and I&#8217;ve ridden
a hard road to-day to get in in time to talk it over
with him. Want to go?&#8221;</p>
<p>Kennedy slapped his leg with the ruler. &#8220;I
always want to go, don&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Farrell, if you hadn&#8217;t been a railroad man you
would have made a great undertaker, do you know
that?&#8221; Kennedy, slapping his leg, showed his
ivory teeth. &#8220;You have such an instinct for
funerals,&#8221; added Whispering Smith.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Mr. Smith! Well, who are we waiting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
for? I&#8217;m ready,&#8221; said Kennedy, taking out his
revolver and examining it.</p>
<p>McCloud put on his new hat and asked if he
should take a gun. &#8220;You are really accompanying
me as my guest, George,&#8221; explained Whispering
Smith reproachfully. &#8220;Won&#8217;t it be fun to
shove this man right under Du Sang&#8217;s nose and
make him bat his eyes?&#8221; he added to Kennedy.
&#8220;Well, put one in your pocket if you like, George,
provided you have one that will go off when sufficiently
urged.&#8221;</p>
<p>McCloud opened the drawer of the table and
took from it a revolver. Whispering Smith
reached out his hand for the gun, examined it,
and handed it back.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith smiled a sickly approbation. &#8220;A forty-five
gun with a thirty-eight bore, George? A
little light for shock; a <i>little</i> light. A bullet is intended
to knock a man down; not necessarily to
kill him, but, if possible, to keep him from killing
you. Never mind, we all have our fads.
Come on!&#8221;</p>
<p>At the foot of the stairs Whispering Smith
stopped. &#8220;Now I don&#8217;t know where we shall find
this man, but we&#8217;ll try the Three Horses.&#8221; As
they started down the street McCloud took the inside
of the sidewalk, but Smith dropped behind and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
brought McCloud into the middle. They failed
to find Du Sang at the Three Horses, and leaving
started to round up the street. They visited
many places, but each was entered in the same way.
Kennedy sauntered in first and moved slowly ahead.
He was to step aside only in case he saw Du Sang.
McCloud in every instance followed him, with
Whispering Smith just behind, amiably surprised.
They spent an hour in and out of the Front Street
resorts, but their search was fruitless.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are sure he is in town?&#8221; asked Kennedy.
The three men stood deliberating in the shadow of
a side street.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; answered Whispering Smith. &#8220;Of
course, if he turns the trick he wants to get away
quietly. He is lying low. Who is that, Farrell?&#8221;
A man passing out of the shadow of a
shade tree was crossing Fort Street a hundred
feet away.</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks like our party,&#8221; whispered Kennedy.
&#8220;No, stop a bit!&#8221; They drew back into the
shadow. &#8220;That is Du Sang,&#8221; said Kennedy; &#8220;I
know his hobble.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>A TEST</h3>
</div>
<p>Du Sang had the sidewise gait of a wolf,
and crossed the street with the choppy walk
of the man out of a long saddle. Being both uncertain
and quick, he was a man to slip a trail easily.
He travelled around the block and disappeared
among the many open doors that blazed along
Hill Street. Less alert trailers than the two behind
him would have been at fault; but when he
entered the place he was looking for, Kennedy
was so close that Du Sang could have spoken to
him had he turned around.</p>
<p>Kennedy passed directly ahead. A moment
later Whispering Smith put his head inside the
door of the joint Du Sang had entered, withdrew
it, and, rejoining his companions, spoke in an undertone:
&#8220;A negro dive; he&#8217;s lying low. Now we
will keep our regular order. It&#8217;s a half-basement,
with a bar on the left; crap games at the table
behind the screen on the right. Kennedy, will you
take the rear end of the bar? It covers the whole
room and the back door. George, pass in ahead
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
of me and step just to the left of the slot machine;
you&#8217;ve got the front door there and everything
behind the screen, and I can get close to Du Sang.
Look for a thinnish, yellow-faced man with a
brown hat and a brown shirt&ndash;&ndash;and pink eyes&ndash;&ndash;shooting
craps under this window. I&#8217;ll shoot craps
with him. Is your heart pumping, George?
Never mind, this is easy! Farrell, you&#8217;re first!&#8221;</p>
<p>The dive, badly lighted and ventilated, was
counted tough among tough places. White men
and colored mixed before the bar and about the
tables. When Smith stepped around the screen
and into the flare of the hanging lamps, Du Sang
stood in the small corner below the screened street
window. McCloud, though vitally interested in
looking at the man that had come to town to kill
him, felt his attention continually wandering back
to Whispering Smith. The clatter of the rolling
dice, the guttural jargon of the negro gamblers,
the drift of men to and from the bar, and the
clouds of tobacco smoke made a hazy background
for the stoop-shouldered man with his gray hat and
shabby coat, dust-covered and travel-stained. Industriously
licking the broken wrapper of a cheap
cigar and rolling it fondly under his forefinger, he
was making his way unostentatiously toward Du
Sang. Thirty-odd men were in the saloon, but only
two knew what the storm centre moving slowly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
across the room might develop. Kennedy, seeing
everything and talking pleasantly with one of the
barkeepers, his close-set teeth gleaming twenty
feet away, stood at the end of the bar sliding an
empty glass between his hands. Whispering Smith
pushed past the on-lookers to get to the end of the
table where Du Sang was shooting. He made no
effort to attract Du Sang&#8217;s attention, and when the
latter looked up he could have pulled the gray hat
from the head of the man whose brown eyes were
mildly fixed on Du Sang&#8217;s dice; they were lying
just in front of Smith. Looking indifferently at
the intruder, Du Sang reached for the dice: just
ahead of his right hand, Whispering Smith&#8217;s right
hand, the finger-tips extended on the table, rested
in front of them; it might have been through accident
or it might have been through design. In
his left hand Smith held the broken cigar, and
without looking at Du Sang he passed the wrapper
again over the tip of his tongue and slowly across
his lips.</p>
<p>Du Sang now looked sharply at him, and Smith
looked at his cigar. Others were playing around
the semicircular table&ndash;&ndash;it might mean nothing.
Du Sang waited. Smith lifted his right hand from
the table and felt in his waistcoat for a match.
Du Sang, however, made no effort to take up the
dice. He watched Whispering Smith scratch a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
match on the table, and, either because it failed to
light or through design, it was scratched the second
time on the table, marking a cross between the
two dice.</p>
<p>The meanest negro in the joint would not have
stood that, yet Du Sang hesitated. Whispering
Smith, mildly surprised, looked up. &#8220;Hello,
Pearline! You shooting here?&#8221; He pushed the
dice back toward the outlaw. &#8220;Shoot again!&#8221;</p>
<p>Du Sang, scowling, snapped the dice and threw
badly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Up jump the devil, is it? Shoot again!&#8221;
And, pushing back the dice, Smith moved closer to
Du Sang. The two men touched arms. Du Sang,
threatened in a way wholly new to him, waited
like a snake braved by a mysterious enemy. His
eyes blinked like a badger&#8217;s. He caught up the dice
and threw. &#8220;Is that the best you can do?&#8221; asked
Smith. &#8220;See here!&#8221; He took up the dice.
&#8220;Shoot with me!&#8221; Smith threw the dice up the
table toward Du Sang. Once he threw craps, but,
reaching directly in front of Du Sang, he picked
the dice up and threw eleven. &#8220;Shoot with me,
Du Sang.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your game?&#8221; snapped Du Sang, with
an oath.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you care, if I&#8217;ve got the coin? I&#8217;ll
throw you for twenty-dollar gold pieces.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></div>
<p>Du Sang&#8217;s eyes glittered. Unable to understand
the reason for the affront, he stood like a
cat waiting to spring. &#8220;This is my game!&#8221; he
snarled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then play it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, what do you want?&#8221; he demanded
angrily.</p>
<p>Smith stepped closer. &#8220;Any game you&#8217;ve got.
I&#8217;ll throw you left-handed, Du Sang.&#8221; With his
right hand he snapped the dice under Du Sang&#8217;s
nose and looked squarely into his eyes. &#8220;Got any
Sugar Buttes money?&#8221;</p>
<p>Du Sang for an instant looked keenly back; his
eyes contracted in that time to a mere narrow slit;
then, sudden as thought, he sprang back into the
corner. He knew now. This was the man who
held the aces at the barbecue, the railroad man&ndash;&ndash;Whispering
Smith. Kennedy, directly across the
table, watched the lightning-like move. For the
first time the crap-dealer looked impatiently up.</p>
<p>It was a showdown. No one watching the two
men under the window breathed for a moment.
Whispering Smith, motionless, only watched the
half-closed eyes. &#8220;You can&#8217;t shoot craps,&#8221; he said
coldly. &#8220;What can you shoot, Pearline? You
can&#8217;t stop a man on horseback.&#8221;</p>
<p>Du Sang knew he must try for a quick kill or
make a retreat. He took in the field at a glance.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
Kennedy&#8217;s teeth gleamed only ten feet away, and
with his right hand half under his coat lapel he
toyed with his watch-chain. McCloud had moved
in from the slot machine and stood at the point of
the table, looking at Du Sang and laughing at him.
Whispering Smith threw off all pretence. &#8220;Take
your hand away from your gun, you albino! I&#8217;ll
blow your head off left-handed if you pull! Will
you get out of this town to-night? If you can&#8217;t
drop a man in the saddle at two hundred and fifty
yards, what do you think you&#8217;d look like after a
break with me? Go back to the whelp that hired
you, and tell him when he wants a friend of mine
to send a man that can shoot. If you are within
twenty miles of Medicine Bend at daylight I&#8217;ll
rope you like a fat cow and drag you down Front
Street!&#8221;</p>
<p>Du Sang, with burning eyes, shrank narrower
and smaller into his corner, ready to shoot if he
had to, but not liking the chances. No man in
Williams Cache could pull or shoot with Du Sang,
but no man in the mountains had ever drawn successfully
against the man that faced him.</p>
<p>Whispering Smith saw that he would not draw.
He taunted him again in low tones, and, backing
away, spoke laughingly to McCloud. While Kennedy
covered the corner, Smith backed to the door
and waited for the two to join him. They halted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
a moment at the door, then they backed slowly up
the steps and out into the street.</p>
<p>There was no talk till they reached the Wickiup
office. &#8220;Now, will some of you tell me who Du
Sang is?&#8221; asked McCloud, after Kennedy and
Whispering Smith with banter and laughing had
gone over the scene.</p>
<p>Kennedy picked up the ruler. &#8220;The wickedest,
cruelest man in the bunch&ndash;&ndash;and the best shot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is your hat, George&ndash;&ndash;the one he put
the bullet through?&#8221; asked Whispering Smith,
limp in the big chair. &#8220;Burn it up; he thinks he
missed you. Burn it up now. Never let him find
out what a close call you had. Du Sang! Yes, he
is cold-blooded as a wild-cat and cruel as a soft
bullet. Du Sang would shoot a dying man,
George, just to keep him squirming in the dirt.
Did you ever see such eyes in a human being, set
like that and blinking so in the light? It&#8217;s bad
enough to watch a man when you can see his eyes.
Here&#8217;s hoping we&#8217;re done with him!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>NEW PLANS</h3>
</div>
<p>Callahan crushed the tobacco under his
thumb in the palm of his right hand. &#8220;So
I am sorry to add,&#8221; he concluded, speaking to McCloud,
&#8220;that you are now out of a job.&#8221; The
two men were facing each other across the table
in McCloud&#8217;s office. &#8220;Personally, I am not sorry
to say it, either,&#8221; added Callahan, slowly filling
the bowl of his pipe.</p>
<p>McCloud said nothing to the point, as there
seemed to be nothing to say until he had heard
more. &#8220;I never knew before that you were left-handed,&#8221;
he returned evasively.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a lucky thing, because it won&#8217;t do for a
freight-traffic man, nowadays, to let his right hand
know what his left hand does,&#8221; observed Callahan,
feeling for a match. &#8220;I am the only left-handed
man in the traffic department, but the man
that handles the rebates, Jimmie Black, is cross-eyed.
Bucks offered to send him to Chicago to
have Bryson straighten his eyes, but Jimmie thinks
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
it is better to have them as they are for the present,
so he can look at a thing in two different ways&ndash;&ndash;one
for the Interstate Commerce Commission and
one for himself. You haven&#8217;t heard, then?&#8221; continued
Callahan, returning to his riddle about
McCloud&#8217;s job. &#8220;Why, Lance Dunning has
gone into the United States Court and got an injunction
against us on the Crawling Stone Line&ndash;&ndash;tied
us up tighter than zero. No more construction
there for a year at least. Dunning comes in
for himself and for a cousin who is his ward, and
three or four little ranchers have filed bills&ndash;&ndash;so it&#8217;s
up to the lawyers for eighty per cent. of the gate
receipts and peace. Personally, I&#8217;m glad of it.
It gives you a chance to look after this operating
for a year yourself. We are going to be swamped
with freight traffic this year, and I want it moved
through the mountains like checkers for the next
six months. You know what I mean, George.&#8221;</p>
<p>To McCloud the news came, in spite of himself,
as a blow. The results he had attained in
building through the lower valley had given him
a name among the engineers of the whole line.
The splendid showing of the winter construction,
on which he had depended to enable him to finish
the whole work within the year, was by this news
brought to naught. Those of the railroad men
who said he could not deliver a completed line
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
within the year could never be answered now. And
there was some slight bitterness in the reflection
that the very stumbling-block to hold him back, to
rob him of his chance for a reputation with men
like Glover and Bucks, should be the lands of
Dicksie Dunning.</p>
<p>He made no complaint. On the division he
took hold with new energy and bent his faculties
on the operating problems. At Marion&#8217;s he saw
Dicksie at intervals, and only to fall more hopelessly
under her spell each time. She could be
serious and she could be volatile and she could be
something between which he could never quite
make out. She could be serious with him when
he was serious, and totally irresponsible the next
minute with Marion. On the other hand, when
McCloud attempted to be flippant, Dicksie could
be confusingly grave. Once when he was bantering
with her at Marion&#8217;s she tried to say something
about her regret that complications over the
right of way should have arisen; but McCloud
made light of it, and waved the matter aside as if
he were a cavalier. Dicksie did not like it, but
it was only that he was afraid she would realize
he was a mere railroad superintendent with hopes
of a record for promotion quite blasted. And as
if this obstacle to a greater reputation were not
enough, a wilier enemy threatened in the spring to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
leave only shreds and patches of what he had
already earned.</p>
<p>The Crawling Stone River is said to embody,
historically, all of the deceits known to mountain
streams. Below the Box Canyon it ploughs
through a great bed of yielding silt, its own deposit
between the two imposing lines of bluffs that
resist its wanderings from side to side of the wide
valley. This fertile soil makes up the rich lands
that are the envy of less fortunate regions in the
Great Basin; but the Crawling Stone is not a river
to give quiet title to one acre of its own making.
The toil of its centuries spreads beautifully green
under the June skies, and the unsuspecting settler,
lulled into security by many years of the river&#8217;s repose,
settles on its level bench lands and lays out his
long lines of possession; but the Sioux will tell you
in their own talk that this man is but a tenant at
will; that in another time and at another place
the stranger will inherit his fields; and that the
Crawling Stone always comes back for its own.</p>
<p>This was the peril that Glover and McCloud
essayed when they ran a three-tenths grade and
laid an eighty-pound rail up two hundred and fifty
miles of the valley. It was in local and exclusive
territory a rich prize, and they brought to their
undertaking not, perhaps, greater abilities than
other men, but incomparably greater material
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
resources than earlier American engineers had
possessed.</p>
<p>Success such as theirs is cumulative: when the
work is done one man stands for it, but it represents
the work of a thousand men in every walk
of American industry. Where the credit must lie
with the engineer who achieves is in the application
of these enormous reserves of industrial triumphs
to the particular conditions he faces in the problem
before him; in the application lies the genius
called success, and this is always new. Moreover,
men like Glover and McCloud were fitted for a
fight with a mountain river because trained in the
Western school, where poverty or resource had
sharpened the wits. The building of the Crawling
Stone Line came with the dawn of a new day in
American capital, when figures that had slept in
fairies&#8217; dreams woke into every-day use, and when
enlarged calculation among men controlling hitherto
unheard-of sums of money demanded the best
and most permanent methods of construction to insure
enduring economies in operating. Thus the
constructing of the Crawling Stone Line opened in
itself new chapters in Rocky Mountain railroad-building.
An equipment of machinery, much of
which had never before been applied to such
building, had been assembled by the engineers.
Steam-shovels had been sent in battalions, grading-machines
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
and dump-wagons had gone forward in
trainloads, and an army of men were operating in
the valley. A huge steel bridge three thousand feet
long was now being thrown across the river below
the Dunning ranch.</p>
<p>The winter had been an unusual one even in a
land of winters. The season&#8217;s fall of snow had
not been above an average, but it had fallen in
the spring and had been followed by excessively
low temperatures throughout the mountains. June
came again, but a strange June. The first rise of
the Crawling Stone had not moved out the winter
frost, and the stream lay bound from bank to bank,
and for hundreds of miles, under three feet of ice.
When June opened, backward and cold, there had
been no spring. Heavy frosts lasting until the
middle of the month gave sudden way to summer
heat, and the Indians on the upper-valley reservation
began moving back into the hills. Then came
the rise. Creek after creek in the higher mountains,
ice-bound for six months, burst without warning
into flood. Soft winds struck with the sun and
stripped the mountain walls of their snow. Rains
set in on the desert, and far in the high northwest
the Crawling Stone lifting its four-foot cap of ice
like a bed of feathers began rolling it end over
end down the valley. In the Box, forty feet of
water struck the canyon walls and ice-floes were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
hurled like torpedoes against the granite spurs:
the Crawling Stone was starting after its own.</p>
<p>When the river rose, the earlier talk of Dunning&#8217;s
men had been that the Crawling Stone
would put an end to the railroad pretensions by
washing the two hundred and fifty miles of track
back to the Peace River, where it had started.
This much in the beginning was easy to predict;
but the railroad men had turned out in force to
fight for their holdings, and while the ranchers
were laughing, the river was flowing over the bench
lands in the upper valley.</p>
<p>At the Dunning ranch the confidence of the
men in their own security gave way to confusion
as the river, spreading behind the ice-jams into
broad lakes and bursting in torrents through its
barriers, continued to rise. Treacherous in its
broad and yellow quiet, lifting its muddy head in
the stillness of the night, moving unheard over
broad sandy bottoms, backing noiselessly into forgotten
channels, stealing through heavy alfalfa
pastures, eating a channel down a slender furrow&ndash;&ndash;then,
with the soil melting from the root, the
plant has toppled at the head, the rivulet has grown
a stream; night falls, and in the morning where
yesterday smiling miles of green fields looked up
to the sun rolls a mad flood of waters: this
is the Crawling Stone.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>THE CRAWLING STONE RISE</h3>
</div>
<p>So sudden was the onset of the river that the
trained riders of the big ranch were taken
completely aback, and hundreds of head of Dunning
cattle were swept away before they could be
removed to points of safety. Fresh alarms came
with every hour of the day and night, and the telephones
up and down the valley rang incessantly
with appeals from neighbor to neighbor. Lance
Dunning, calling out the reserves of his vocabulary,
swore tremendously and directed the operations
against the river. These seemed, indeed, to consist
mainly of hard riding and hard language on
the part of everybody. Murray Sinclair, although
he had sold his ranch on the Crawling Stone and
was concentrating his holdings on the Frenchman,
was everywhere in evidence. He was the first at a
point of danger and the last to ride away from the
slipping acres where the muddy flood undercut; but
no defiance seemed to disturb the Crawling Stone,
which kept alarmingly at work.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></div>
<p>Above the alfalfa lands on the long bench north
of the house the river, in changing its course many
years earlier, had left a depression known as Mud
Lake. It had become separated from the main
channel of the Crawling Stone by a high, narrow
barrier in the form of a bench deposited by the receding
waters of some earlier flood, and added to
by sand-storms sweeping among the willows that
overspread it. Without an effective head or definite
system of work the efforts of the men at the
Stone Ranch were of no more consequence than if
they had spent their time in waving blankets at the
river. Twenty men riding in together to tell Lance
Dunning that the river was washing out the tree
claims above Mud Lake made no perceptible difference
in the event. Dicksie, though an inexperienced
girl, saw with helpless clearness the futility of it
all. The alarms and the continual failures of the
army of able-bodied men directed by Sinclair and
her cousin wore on her spirit. The river rose until
each succeeding inch became a menace to the life
and property of the ranch, and in the midst of it
came the word that the river was cutting into
the willows and heading for Mud Lake. All knew
what that meant. If the Crawling Stone should
take its old channel, not alone were the two square
miles of alfalfa doomed: it would sweep away
every vestige of the long stacks below the corrals,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
take the barns, and lap the slope in front of the
ranch-house itself.</p>
<p>Terror seized Dicksie. She telephoned in her
distress for Marion, begging her to come up before
they should all be swept away; and Marion,
turning the shop over to Katie Dancing, got into
the ranch-wagon that Dicksie had sent and started
for the Crawling Stone. The confusion along the
river road as the wagon approached the ranch
showed Marion the seriousness of the situation.
Settlers driven from their homes in the upper valley
formed almost a procession of misery-stricken
people, making their way on horseback, on foot,
and in wagons toward Medicine Bend. With them
they were bringing all they had saved from the
flood&ndash;&ndash;the little bunch of cows, the wagonload of
hogs, the household effects, the ponies&ndash;&ndash;as if war
or pestilence had struck the valley.</p>
<p>At noon Marion arrived. The ranch-house was
deserted, and the men were all at the river. Puss
stuck her head out of the kitchen window, and
Dicksie ran out and threw herself into Marion&#8217;s
arms. Late news from the front had been the
worst: the cutting above Mud Lake had weakened
the last barrier that held off the river, and every
available man was fighting the current at that
point.</p>
<p>Marion heard it all while eating a luncheon.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
Dicksie, beset with anxiety, could not stay in the
house. The man that had driven Marion over,
saddled horses in the afternoon and the two
women rode up above Mud Lake, now become
through rainfall and seepage from the river a
long, shallow lagoon. For an hour they watched
the shovelling and carrying of sandbags, and rode
toward the river to the very edge of the disappearing
willows, where the bank was melting away before
the undercut of the resistless current. They
rode away with a common feeling&ndash;&ndash;a conviction
that the fight was a losing one, and that another
day would see the ruin complete.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dicksie,&#8221; exclaimed Marion&ndash;&ndash;they were riding
to the house as she spoke&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you
what we <i>can</i> do!&#8221; She hesitated a moment.
&#8220;I will tell you what we <i>can</i> do! Are you
plucky?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dicksie looked at Marion pathetically.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you are plucky enough to do it, we can keep
the river off yet. I have an idea. I will go, but
you must come along.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Marion, what do you mean? Don&#8217;t you think
I would go anywhere to save the ranch? I should
like to know where you dare go in this country that
I dare not!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then ride with me over to the railroad camp
by the new bridge. We will ask Mr. McCloud to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
bring some of his men over. He can stop the
river; he knows how.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dicksie caught her breath. &#8220;Oh, Marion! that
would do no good, even if I could do it. Why, the
railroad has been all swept away in the lower
valley.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So every one says.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is every one?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cousin Lance, Mr. Sinclair&ndash;&ndash;all the men. I
heard that a week ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dicksie, don&#8217;t believe it. You don&#8217;t know
these railroad men. They understand this kind of
thing; cattlemen, you know, don&#8217;t. If you will go
with me we can get help. I feel just as sure that
those men can control the river as I do that I am
looking at you&ndash;&ndash;that is, if anybody can. The
question is, do you want to make the effort?&#8221;</p>
<p>They talked until they left the horses and entered
the house. When they sat down, Dicksie put
her hands to her face. &#8220;Oh, I wish you had said
nothing about it! How <i>can</i> I go to him and ask
for help now&ndash;&ndash;after Cousin Lance has gone into
court about the line and everything? And of
course my name is in it all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dicksie, don&#8217;t raise spectres that have nothing
to do with the case. If we go to him and ask him
for help he will give it to us if he can; if he can&#8217;t,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
what harm is done? He has been up and down
the river for three weeks, and he has an army of
men camped over by the bridge. I know that,
because Mr. Smith rode in from there a few
days ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What, Whispering Smith? Oh, if he is there
I would not go for worlds!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pray, why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, he is such an awful man!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is absurd, Dicksie.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dicksie looked grave. &#8220;Marion, no man in
this part of the country has a good word to say
for Whispering Smith.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you have forgotten, Dicksie, that you
live in a very rough part of the country,&#8221; returned
Marion coolly. &#8220;No man that he has ever hunted
down would have anything pleasant to say about
him; nor would the friends of such a man be likely
to say a good word of him. There are many on
the range, Dicksie, that have no respect for life
or law or anything else, and they naturally hate a
man like Whispering Smith&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Marion, he killed&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know. He killed a man named Williams a
few years ago, while you were at school&ndash;&ndash;one of
the worst men that ever infested this country.
Williams Cache is named after that man; he made
the most beautiful spot in all these mountains a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
nest of thieves and murderers. But did you know
that Williams shot down Gordon Smith&#8217;s only
brother, a trainmaster, in cold blood in front of the
Wickiup at Medicine Bend? No, you never heard
that in this part of the country, did you? They
had a cow-thief for sheriff then, and no officer
in Medicine Bend would go after the murderer.
He rode in and out of town as if he owned it, and
no one dared say a word, and, mind you, Gordon
Smith&#8217;s brother had never seen the man in his life
until he walked up and shot him dead. Oh, this
was a peaceful country a few years ago! Gordon
Smith was right-of-way man in the mountains then.
He buried his brother, and asked the officers what
they were going to do about getting the murderer.
They laughed at him. He made no protest, except
to ask for a deputy United States marshal&#8217;s commission.
When he got it he started for Williams
Cache after Williams in a buckboard&ndash;&ndash;think of it,
Dicksie&ndash;&ndash;and didn&#8217;t they laugh at him! He did
not even know the trails, and imagine riding two
hundred miles in a buckboard to arrest a man in
the mountains! He was gone six weeks, and came
back with Williams&#8217;s body strapped to the buckboard
behind him. He never told the story; all
he said when he handed in his commission and
went back to his work was that the man was killed
in a fair fight. Hate him! No wonder they hate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
him&ndash;&ndash;the Williams Cache gang and all their
friends on the range! Your cousin thinks it policy
to placate that element, hoping that they won&#8217;t
steal your cattle if you are friendly with them. I
know nothing about that, but I do know something
about Whispering Smith. It will be a bad day for
Williams Cache when they start him up again.
But what has that to do with your trouble? He
will not eat you up if you go to the camp, Dicksie.
You are just raising bogies.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had moved to the front porch and Marion
was sitting in the rocking-chair. Dicksie stood
with her back against one of the pillars and looked
at her. As Marion finished Dicksie turned and,
with her hand on her forehead, looked in wretchedness
of mind out on the valley. As far, in many
directions, as the eye could reach the waters spread
yellow in the flood of sunshine across the lowlands.
There was a moment of silence. Dicksie turned
her back on the alarming sight. &#8220;Marion, I can&#8217;t
do it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, you can if you want to, Dicksie!&#8221;
Dicksie looked at her with tearless eyes. &#8220;It is
only a question of being plucky enough,&#8221; insisted
Marion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pluck has nothing to do with it!&#8221; exclaimed
Dicksie in fiery tones. &#8220;I should like to know why
you are always talking about my not having courage!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
This isn&#8217;t a question of courage. How can
I go to a man that I talked to as I talked to him
in your house and ask for help? How can I go
to him after my cousin has threatened to kill him,
and gone into court to prevent his coming on our
land? Shouldn&#8217;t I look beautiful asking help
from him?&#8221;</p>
<p>Marion rocked with perfect composure. &#8220;No,
dear, you would not look beautiful asking help,
but you would look sensible. It is so easy to be
beautiful and so hard to be sensible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are just as horrid as you can be, Marion
Sinclair!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that, too, dear. All I wanted to say is
that you would look very sensible just now in asking
help from Mr. McCloud.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care&ndash;&ndash;I won&#8217;t do it. I will never do
it, not if every foot of the ranch tumbles into the
river. I hope it will! Nobody cares anything
about me. I have no friends but thieves and outlaws.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dicksie!&#8221; Marion rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is what you said.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not. I am your friend. How dare you
call me names?&#8221; demanded Marion, taking the
petulant girl in her arms. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think I
care anything about you? There are people in this
country that you have never seen who know you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
and love you almost as much as I do. Don&#8217;t let
any silly pride prevent your being sensible, dear.&#8221;
Dicksie burst into tears. Marion drew her over to
the settee, and she had her cry out. When it was
over they changed the subject. Dicksie went to her
room. It was a long time before she came down
again, but Marion rocked in patience: she was resolved
to let Dicksie fight it out herself.</p>
<p>When Dicksie came down, Marion stood at
the foot of the stairs. The young mistress of
Crawling Stone Ranch descended step by step very
slowly. &#8220;Marion,&#8221; she said simply, &#8220;I will go
with you.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>AT THE DIKE</h3>
</div>
<p>Marion caught her closely to her heart. &#8220;I
knew you would go if I got you angry,
dear. But you are so slow to anger. Mr. McCloud
is just the same way. Mr. Smith says when
he does get angry he can do anything. He is very
like you in so many ways.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dicksie was wiping her eyes. &#8220;Is he, Marion?
Well, what shall I wear?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just your riding-clothes, dear, and a smile.
He won&#8217;t know what you have on. It is you he
will want to see. But I&#8217;ve been thinking of something
else. What will your Cousin Lance say?
Suppose he should object?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Object! I should like to see <i>him</i> object
after losing the fight himself.&#8221; Marion laughed.
&#8220;Well, do you think you can find the way down
there for us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can find any way anywhere within a hundred
miles of here.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the 20th of June McCloud did have something
of an army of men in the Crawling Stone Valley.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
Of these, two hundred and fifty were in the
vicinity of the bridge, the abutments and piers of
which were being put in just below the Dunning
ranch. Near at hand Bill Dancing, with a big
gang, had been for some time watching the ice and
dynamiting the jams. McCloud brought in more
men as the river continued to rise. The danger line
on the gauges was at length submerged, and for
three days the main-line construction camps had
been robbed of men to guard the soft grades above
and below the bridge. The new track up and down
the valley had become a highway of escape from the
flood, and the track patrols were met at every
curve by cattle, horses, deer, wolves, and coyotes
fleeing from the waste of waters that spread over
the bottoms.</p>
<p>Through the Dunning ranch the Crawling Stone
River makes a far bend across the valley to the
north and east. The extraordinary volume of
water now pouring through the Box Canyon exposed
ten thousand acres of the ranch to the
caprice of the river, and if at the point of its tremendous
sweep to the north it should cut back
into its old channel the change would wipe the
entire body of ranch alfalfa lands off the face of
the valley. With the heat of the lengthening June
days a vast steam rose from the chill waters of
the river, marking in ominous windings the channel
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
of the main stream through a yellow sea which,
ignoring the usual landmarks of trees and dunes,
flanked the current broadly on either side. Late
in the afternoon of the day that Dicksie with Marion
sought McCloud, a storm drifted down the
Topah Topah Hills, and heavy showers broke
across the valley.</p>
<p>At nightfall the rain had passed and the mist
lifted from the river. Above the bluffs rolling
patches of cloud obscured the face of the moon,
but the distant thunder had ceased, and at midnight
the valley near the bridge lay in a stillness
broken only by the hoarse calls of the patrols and
far-off megaphones. From the bridge camp, which
lay on high ground near the grade, the distant
lamps of the track-walkers could be seen moving
dimly.</p>
<p>Before the camp-fire in front of McCloud&#8217;s tent
a group of men, smoking and talking, sat or
lay sprawled on tarpaulins, drying themselves after
the long day. Among them were the weather-beaten
remnants of the old guard of the mountain-river
workers, men who had ridden in the caboose
the night that Hailey went to his death,
and had fought the Spider Water with Glover.
Bill Dancing, huge, lumbering, awkward as a bear
and as shifty, was talking, because with no apparent
effort he could talk all night, and was a valuable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
man at keeping the camp awake. Bill Dancing
talked and, after Sinclair&#8217;s name had been
dropped from the roll, ate and drank more than
any two men on the division. A little apart, McCloud
lay on a leather caboose cushion trying to
get a nap.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was the day George McCloud came,&#8221; continued
Dancing, spinning a continuous story.
&#8220;Nobody was drinking&ndash;&ndash;Murray Sinclair started
that yarn. I was getting fixed up a little for to
meet George McCloud, so I asked the barber for
some tonic, and he understood me for to say dye for
my whiskers, and he gets out the dye and begins
to dye my whiskers. My cigar went out whilst
he was shampooing me, and my whiskers was wet
up with the dye. He turned around to put down
th&#8217; bottle, and I started for to light my cigar with a
parlor-match, and, by gum! away went my whiskers
on fire&ndash;&ndash;burnt jus&#8217; like a tumbleweed. There
was the barbers all running around at once trying
for to choke me with towels, and running for water,
and me sitting there blazing like a tar-barrel.
That&#8217;s all there was to that story. I went over
to Doc Torpy&#8217;s and got bandaged up, and he
wanted me for to go to the hospit&#8217;l&ndash;&ndash;but I was
going for to meet George McCloud.&#8221; Bill raised
his voice a little and threw his tones carelessly over
toward the caboose cushion: &#8220;And I was the on&#8217;y
man on the platform when his train pulled in.
His car was on the hind end. I walked back and
waited for some one to come out. It was about
seven o&#8217;clock in the evening and they was eating
dinner inside, so I set up on the fence for a minute,
and who do you think got out of the car?
That boy laying right over there. &#8216;Where&#8217;s your
dad?&#8217; says I; that&#8217;s exactly what I said. &#8216;Dead,&#8217;
says he. &#8216;Dead!&#8217; says I, surprised-like. &#8216;Dead,&#8217;
says he, &#8216;for many years.&#8217; &#8216;Where&#8217;s the new superintendent?&#8217;
says I. &#8216;I&#8217;m the new superintendent,&#8217;
says he. Well, sir, you could have blowed me
over with a air-hose. &#8216;Go &#8217;way,&#8217; I says. &#8216;What&#8217;s
the matter with your face, Bill?&#8217; he says, while
I was looking at him; now that&#8217;s straight. That
was George McCloud, right over there, the first
time I ever set eyes on him or him on me. The
assertion was met with silence such as might be
termed marked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bucks told him,&#8221; continued Bill Dancing, in
corroborative detail, &#8220;that when he got to Medicine
Bend one man would be waiting for to meet
him. &#8216;He met me,&#8217; says Bucks; &#8216;he&#8217;s met every
superintendent since my time; he&#8217;ll meet you. Go
right up and speak to him,&#8217; Bucks says; &#8216;it&#8217;ll be
all right.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, hell, Bill!&#8221; protested an indignant chorus.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what&#8217;s er matter with you fellows?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
Didn&#8217;t you ask me to tell the story?&#8221; demanded
Dancing angrily. &#8220;If you know it better than I
do, tell it! Give me some tobacco, Chris,&#8221; said
Bill, honoring with the request the only man in the
circle who had shown no scepticism, because he
spoke English with difficulty. &#8220;And say, Chris, go
down and read the bridge gauge, will you? It&#8217;s
close on twelve o&#8217;clock, and he&#8217;s to be called when
it reaches twenty-eight feet. I said the boy could
never run the division without help from every
man on it, and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m giving him, and I
don&#8217;t care who knows it,&#8221; said Bill Dancing, raising
his voice not too much. &#8220;Bucks says that
any man that c&#8217;n run this division c&#8217;n run any
railroad on earth. Shoo! now who&#8217;s this coming
here on horseback? Clouding up again, too, by
gum!&#8221;</p>
<p>The man sent to the bridge had turned back,
and behind his lantern Dancing heard the tread
of horses. He stood at one side of the camp-fire
while two visitors rode up; they were women.
Dancing stood dumb as they advanced into the
firelight. The one ahead spoke: &#8220;Mr. Dancing,
don&#8217;t you know me?&#8221; As she stopped her horse
the light of the fire struck her face. &#8220;Why, Mis&#8217;
Sinclair!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and Miss Dunning is with me,&#8221; returned
Marion. Bill staggered. &#8220;This is an awful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
place to get to; we have been nearly drowned, and
we want to see Mr. McCloud.&#8221;</p>
<p>McCloud, roused by Marion&#8217;s voice, came forward.
&#8220;You were asleep,&#8221; said she as he greeted
her. &#8220;I am so sorry we have disturbed you!&#8221;
She looked careworn and a little forlorn, yet but
a little considering the struggle she and Dicksie had
made to reach the camp.</p>
<p>Light blazed from the camp-fire, where Dicksie
stood talking with Dancing about horses.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are in desperate straits up at the ranch,&#8221;
Marion went on, when McCloud had assured her
of her welcome. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see how they can save it.
The river is starting to flow into the old channel
and there&#8217;s a big pond right in the alfalfa fields.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will play the deuce with things if it gets
through there,&#8221; mused McCloud. &#8220;I wonder
how the river is? I&#8217;ve been asleep. O Bill!&#8221; he
called to Dancing, &#8220;what water have you got?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Twenty-eight six just now, sir. She&#8217;s a-raising
very, very slow, Mr. McCloud.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So I am responsible for this invasion,&#8221; continued
Marion calmly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been up with Dicksie
at the ranch; she sent for me. Just think of it&ndash;&ndash;no
woman but old Puss within ten miles of the
poor child! And they have been trying everywhere
to get bags, and you have all the bags, and the
men have been buzzing around over there for a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
week like bumblebees and doing just about as
much good. She and I talked it all over this afternoon,
and I told her I was coming over here to
see you, and we started out together&ndash;&ndash;and merciful
goodness, such a time as we have had!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you started out together; where did you
leave her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There she stands the other side of the fire.
O Dicksie!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you not tell me she was here!&#8221; exclaimed
McCloud.</p>
<p>Dicksie came into the light as he hastened over.
If she was uncertain in manner, he was not. He
met her, laughing just enough to relieve the tension
of which both for an instant were conscious. She
gave him her hand when he put his out, though he
felt that it trembled a little. &#8220;Such a ride as you
have had! Why did you not send me word? I
would have come to you!&#8221; he exclaimed, throwing
reproach into the words.</p>
<p>Dicksie raised her eyes. &#8220;I wanted to ask you
whether you would sell us some grain-sacks, Mr.
McCloud, to use at the river, if you could spare
them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sacks? Why, of course, all you want! But
how did you <i>ever</i> get here? In all this water, and
two lone women! You have been in danger to-night.
Indeed you have&ndash;&ndash;don&#8217;t tell me! And you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
are both wet; I know it. Your feet must be wet.
Come to the fire. O Bill!&#8221; he called to Dancing,
&#8220;what&#8217;s the matter with your wood? Let us
have a fire, won&#8217;t you?&ndash;&ndash;one worth while; and build
another in front of my tent. I can&#8217;t believe you
have ridden here all the way from the ranch, two
of you alone!&#8221; exclaimed McCloud, hastening
boxes up to the fire for seats.</p>
<p>Marion laughed. &#8220;Dicksie can go anywhere!
I couldn&#8217;t have ridden from the house to the barns
alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then tell me how <i>you</i> could do it?&#8221; demanded
McCloud, devouring Dicksie with his
eyes.</p>
<p>Dicksie looked at the fire. &#8220;I know all the
roads pretty well. We did get lost once,&#8221; she confessed
in a low voice, &#8220;but we got out again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The roads are all underwater, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What time is it, please?&#8221;</p>
<p>McCloud looked at his watch. &#8220;Two minutes
past twelve.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dicksie started. &#8220;Past twelve? Oh, this is
dreadful! We must start right back, Marion. I
had no idea we had been five hours coming five
miles.&#8221;</p>
<p>McCloud looked at her, as if still unable to comprehend
what she had accomplished in crossing the
flooded bottoms. Her eyes fell back to the fire.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
&#8220;What a blaze!&#8221; she murmured as the driftwood
snapped and roared. &#8220;It&#8217;s fine for to-night,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you both must have been in the water,&#8221;
he insisted, leaning forward in front of Dicksie to
feel Marion&#8217;s skirt.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not wet!&#8221; declared Marion, drawing back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense, you are wet as a rat! Tell me,&#8221;
he asked, looking at Dicksie, &#8220;about your trouble
up at the bend. I know something about it.
Are the men there to-night? Given up, have they?
Too bad! Do open your jackets and try to dry
yourselves, both of you, and I&#8217;ll take a look at the
river.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose&ndash;&ndash;I only say suppose&ndash;&ndash;you first take
a look at me.&#8221; The voice came from behind
the group at the fire, and the three turned together.</p>
<p>&#8220;By Heaven, Gordon Smith!&#8221; exclaimed McCloud.
&#8220;Where did you come from?&#8221;</p>
<p>Whispering Smith stood in the gloom in patience.
&#8220;Where do I look as if I had come from?
Why don&#8217;t you ask me whether I&#8217;m wet? And
won&#8217;t you introduce me&ndash;&ndash;but this is Miss Dicksie
Dunning, I am sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marion with laughter hastened the introduction.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you are wet, of course,&#8221; said McCloud,
feeling Smith&#8217;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, only soaked. I have fallen into the river
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
two or three times, and the last time a big rhinoceros
of yours down the grade, a section foreman
named Klein, was obliging enough to pull me out.
Oh, no! I was not looking for you,&#8221; he ran on,
answering McCloud&#8217;s question; &#8220;not when he
pulled me out. I was just looking for a farm or
a ladder or something. Klein, for a man named
Small, is the biggest Dutchman I ever saw. &#8216;Tell
me, Klein,&#8217; I asked, after he had quit dragging
me out&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;s a Hanoverian&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;where did you get
your pull? And how about your height? Did
your grandfather serve as a grenadier under old
Frederick William and was he kidnapped?&#8217; Bill,
don&#8217;t feed my horse for a while. And Klein tried
to light a cigar I had just taken from my pocket
and given him&ndash;&ndash;fancy! the Germans are a remarkable
people&ndash;&ndash;and sat down to tell me his history,
when some friend down the line began bawling
through a megaphone, and all that poor Klein had
time to say was that he had had no supper, nor
dinner, nor yet breakfast, and would be obliged
for some by the boat he forwarded me in.&#8221; And,
in closing, Whispering Smith looked cheerfully
around at Marion, at McCloud, and last and
longest of all at Dicksie Dunning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you come from across the river?&#8221; asked
Dicksie, adjusting her wet skirt meekly over her
knees.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You are soaking wet,&#8221; observed Whispering
Smith. &#8220;Across the river?&#8221; he echoed. &#8220;Well,
hardly, my dear Miss Dunning! Every bridge is
out down the valley except the railroad bridge and
there are a few things I don&#8217;t tackle; one is the
Crawling Stone on a tear. No, this was across a
little break in this man McCloud&#8217;s track. I came,
to be frank, from the Dunning Ranch to look up
two women who rode away from there at seven
o&#8217;clock to-night, and I want to say that they gave
me the ride of my life,&#8221; and Whispering Smith
looked all around the circle and back again and
smiled.</p>
<p>Dicksie spoke in amazement. &#8220;How did you
know we rode away? You were not at the ranch
when we left.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t ask him!&#8221; cried Marion.</p>
<p>&#8220;He knows everything,&#8221; explained McCloud.</p>
<p>Whispering Smith turned to Dicksie. &#8220;I was
interested in knowing that they got safely to their
destination&ndash;&ndash;whatever it might be, which was none
of my business. I happened to see a man that had
seen them start, that was all. You don&#8217;t understand?
Well, if you want it in plain English, I
made it my business to see a man who made it
<i>his</i> business to see them. It&#8217;s all very simple, but
these people like to make a mystery of it. Good
women are scarcer than riches, and more to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
prized than fine gold&ndash;&ndash;in my judgment&ndash;&ndash;so I rode
after them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marion put her hand for a moment on his coat
sleeve; he looked at Dicksie with another laugh
and spoke to her because he dared not look toward
Marion. &#8220;Going back to-night, do you say? You
never are.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dicksie answered quite in earnest: &#8220;Oh, but we
are. We must!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you come, then? It&#8217;s taken half the
night to get here, and will take a night and a half
at least to get back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We came to ask Mr. McCloud for some grain-sacks&ndash;&ndash;you
know, they have nothing to work with
at the ranch,&#8221; said Marion; &#8220;and he said we
might have some and we are to send for them in
the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see. But we may as well talk plainly.&#8221;
Smith looked at Dicksie. &#8220;You are as brave and
as game as a girl can be, I know, or you couldn&#8217;t
have done this. Sacks full of sand, with the boys
at the ranch to handle them, would do no more
good to-morrow at the bend than bladders. The
river is flowing into Squaw Lake above there now.
A hundred men that know the game might check
things yet if they&#8217;re there by daylight. Nobody
else, and nothing else on God&#8217;s earth, can.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was silence before the fire. McCloud
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
broke it: &#8220;I can put the hundred men there at
daylight, Gordon, if Miss Dunning and her cousin
want them,&#8221; said McCloud.</p>
<p>Marion sprang to her feet. &#8220;Oh, will you do
that, Mr. McCloud?&#8221;</p>
<p>McCloud looked at Dicksie. &#8220;If they are
wanted.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dicksie tried to look at the fire. &#8220;We have
hardly deserved help from Mr. McCloud at the
ranch,&#8221; she said at last.</p>
<p>He put out his hand. &#8220;I must object. The
first wreck I ever had on this division Miss Dunning
rode twenty miles to offer help. Isn&#8217;t that true?
Why, I would walk a hundred miles to return the
offer to her. Perhaps your cousin would object,&#8221;
he suggested, turning to Dicksie; &#8220;but no, I think
we can manage that. Now what are we going to
do? You two can&#8217;t go back to-night, that is
certain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We must.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you will have to go in boats,&#8221; said Whispering
Smith.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the hill road?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is five feet of water across it in half a
dozen places. I swam my horse through, so
I ought to know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is all back-water, of course, Miss Dunning,&#8221;
explained McCloud. &#8220;Not dangerous.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></div>
<p>&#8220;But moist,&#8221; suggested Whispering Smith,
&#8220;especially in the dark.&#8221;</p>
<p>McCloud looked at Marion. &#8220;Then let&#8217;s be
sensible,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You and Miss Dunning can
have my tent as soon as we have supper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Supper!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Supper is served to all on duty at twelve
o&#8217;clock, and we&#8217;re on duty, aren&#8217;t we? They&#8217;re
about ready to serve now; we eat in the tent,&#8221;
he added, holding out his hand as he heard the
patter of raindrops. &#8220;Rain again! No matter,
we shall be dry under canvas.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dicksie had never seen an engineers&#8217; field headquarters.
Lanterns lighted the interior, and the
folding-table in the middle was strewn with papers
which McCloud swept off into a camp-chest. Two
double cots with an aisle between them stood at
the head of the tent, and, spread with bright Hudson
Bay blankets, looked fresh and undisturbed.
A box-table near the head-pole held an alarm-clock,
a telegraph key, and a telephone, and the wires
ran up the pole behind it. Leather jackets and
sweaters lay on boxes under the tent-walls, and
heavy boots stood in disorderly array along the
foot of the cots. These McCloud, with apologies,
kicked into the corners.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this where you stay?&#8221; asked Dicksie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Four of us sleep in the cots, when we can,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
and an indefinite number lie on the ground when
it rains.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marion looked around her. &#8220;What do you do
when it thunders?&#8221;</p>
<p>The two men were pulling boxes out for
seats; McCloud did not stop to look up. &#8220;I
crawl under the bed&ndash;&ndash;the others don&#8217;t seem to
mind it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which is your bed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whichever I can crawl under quickest. I
usually sleep there.&#8221; He pointed to the one on
the right.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought so. It has the blanket folded back
so neatly, just as if there were sheets under it. I&#8217;ll
bet there aren&#8217;t any.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think this is a summer resort?
Knisely, my assistant, sleeps there, but of course
we are never both in bed at the same time;
he&#8217;s down the river to-night. It&#8217;s a sort of continuous
performance, you know.&#8221; McCloud looked
at Dicksie. &#8220;Take off your coat, won&#8217;t you,
please?&#8221;</p>
<p>Whispering Smith was trying to drag a chest
from the foot of the cot, and Marion stood watching.
&#8220;What are you trying to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get this over to the table for a seat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Silly man! why don&#8217;t you move the table?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dicksie was taking off her coat. &#8220;How inviting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
it all is!&#8221; she smiled. &#8220;And this is where you
stay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When it rains,&#8221; answered McCloud. &#8220;Let
me have your hat, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My hair is a sight, I know. We rode over
rocks and up gullies into the brush&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And through lakes&ndash;&ndash;oh, I know! I can&#8217;t conceive
how you ever got here at all. Your hair is
all right. This is camp, anyway. But if you want
a glass you can have one. Knisely is a great swell;
he&#8217;s just from school, and has no end of things.
I&#8217;ll rob his bag.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t disturb Mr. Knisely&#8217;s bag for the
world!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you are not taking off your hat. You
seem to have something on your mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Help me to get it off my mind, will you,
please?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you will let me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me how to thank you for your generosity.
I came all the way over here to-night to ask you
for just the help you have offered, and I could
not&ndash;&ndash;it stuck in my throat. But that wasn&#8217;t what
was on my mind. Tell me what you thought when
I acted so dreadfully at Marion&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t deserve anything better after placing
myself in such a fool position. Why don&#8217;t you ask
me what I thought the day you acted so beautifully
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
at Crawling Stone Ranch? I thought that the
finest thing I ever saw.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were not to blame at Marion&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I seemed to be, which is just as bad. I am
going to start the &#8216;phones going. It&#8217;s up to me to
make good, you know, in about four hours with a
lot of men and material. Aren&#8217;t you going to take
off your hat?&ndash;&ndash;and your gloves are soaking wet.&#8221;</p>
<p>McCloud took down the receiver, and Dicksie
put her hands slowly to her head to unpin her hat.
It was a broad hat of scarlet felt rolled high above
her forehead, and an eagle&#8217;s quill caught in the
black rosette swept across the front. As she stood
in her clinging riding-skirt and her severely plain
scarlet waist with only a black ascot falling over it,
Whispering Smith looked at her. His eyes did
not rest on the picture too long, but his glance was
searching. He spoke in an aside to Marion.
Marion laughed as she turned her head from
where Dicksie was talking again with McCloud.
&#8220;The best of it is,&#8221; murmured Marion, &#8220;she
hasn&#8217;t a suspicion of how lovely she really is.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>SUPPER IN CAMP</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Will you never be done with your telephoning?&#8221;
asked Marion. McCloud
was still planning the assembling of the men and
teams for the morning. Breakfast and transportation
were to be arranged for, and the men and
teams and material were to be selected from where
they could best be spared. Dicksie, with the fingers
of one hand moving softly over the telegraph key,
sat on a box listening to McCloud&#8217;s conferences and
orders.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cherry says everything is served. Isn&#8217;t it,
Cherry?&#8221; Marion called to the Japanese boy.</p>
<p>Cherry laughed with a guttural joy.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are ready for it,&#8221; announced McCloud,
rising. &#8220;How are we to sit?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are to sit at the head of your own
table,&#8221; said Marion. &#8220;I serve the coffee, so I
sit at the foot; and Mr. Smith may pass the
beans over there, and Dicksie, you are to pour the
condensed milk into the cups.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Or into the river, just as you like,&#8221; suggested
Whispering Smith.</p>
<p>McCloud looked at Marion Sinclair. &#8220;Really,&#8221;
he exclaimed, &#8220;wherever you are it&#8217;s fair weather!
When I see you, no matter how tangled up things
are, I feel right away they are coming out. And
this man is another.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Another what?&#8221; demanded Whispering
Smith.</p>
<p>&#8220;Another care-killer.&#8221; McCloud, speaking to
Dicksie, nodded toward his companion. &#8220;Troubles
slip from your shoulders when he swaggers in,
though he&#8217;s not of the slightest use in the world.
I have only one thing against him. It is a physical
peculiarity, but an indefensible one. You may not
have noticed it, but he is bowlegged.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From riding your scrub railroad horses. I feel
like a sailor ashore when I get off one. Are you
going to eat all the bacon, Mr. McCloud, or do we
draw a portion of it? I didn&#8217;t start out with supper
to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take it all. I suppose it would be useless to
ask where you have been to-day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not in the least, but it would be useless to
tell. I am violating no confidence, though, in saying
I&#8217;m hungry. I certainly shouldn&#8217;t eat this stuff
if I weren&#8217;t, should you, Miss Dunning? And I
don&#8217;t believe you are eating, by the way. Where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
is your appetite? Your ride ought to have sharpened
it. I&#8217;m afraid you are downcast. Oh, don&#8217;t
deny it; it is very plain: but your worry is unnecessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If the rain would only stop,&#8221; said Marion,
&#8220;everybody would cheer up. They haven&#8217;t seen
the sun at the ranch for ten days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This rain doesn&#8217;t count so far as the high
water is concerned,&#8221; said McCloud. &#8220;It is the
weather two hundred and fifty miles above here
that is of more consequence to us, and there it is
clear to-night. As long as the tent doesn&#8217;t leak I
rather like it. Sing your song about fair weather,
Gordon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But can the men work in such a downpour?&#8221;
ventured Dicksie.</p>
<p>The two men looked serious and Marion
laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the morning you will see a hundred of them
marching forward with umbrellas, Mr. McCloud
leading. The Japs carry fans, of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I could forget we are in trouble at
home,&#8221; said Dicksie, taking the badinage gracefully.
&#8220;Worrying people are such a nuisance.
Don&#8217;t protest, for every one knows they are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But we are all in trouble,&#8221; insisted Whispering
Smith. &#8220;Trouble! Why, bless you, it really
is a blessing; pretty successfully disguised, I admit,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
sometimes, but still a blessing. I&#8217;m in trouble
all the time, right now, up to my neck in trouble,
and the water rising this minute. Look at this
man,&#8221; he nodded toward McCloud. &#8220;He is in
trouble, and the five hundred under him, they are
in all kinds of trouble. I shouldn&#8217;t know how to
sleep without trouble,&#8221; continued Whispering
Smith, warming to the contention. &#8220;Without
trouble I lose my appetite. McCloud, don&#8217;t be
tight; pass the bread.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never heard him do so well,&#8221; declared McCloud,
looking at Marion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seriously, now,&#8221; Whispering Smith went on,
&#8220;don&#8217;t you know people who, if they were thoroughly
prosperous, would be intolerable&ndash;&ndash;simply
intolerable? I know several such. All thoroughly
prosperous people are a nuisance. That is a general
proposition, and I stand by it. Go over your
list of acquaintances and you will admit it is true.
Here&#8217;s to trouble! May it always chasten and
never overwhelm us: our greatest bugbear and our
best friend! It sifts our friends and unmasks our
enemies. Like a lovely woman, it woos us&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, never!&#8221; exclaimed Marion. &#8220;A lovely
woman doesn&#8217;t woo, she is wooed!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you looking for, perfection in rhetorical
figure? This is extemporaneous.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it won&#8217;t do!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span></div>
<p>&#8220;And asks to be conquered,&#8221; suggested Whispering
Smith.</p>
<p>&#8220;Asks! Oh, scandalous, Mr. Smith!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is easy to see why <i>he</i> never could get any
one to marry him,&#8221; declared McCloud over the
bacon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on, then! Like lovely woman, it does
not seek us, we seek it,&#8221; persisted the orator,
&#8220;<i>That</i> at least is so, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is better,&#8221; assented Marion.</p>
<p>&#8220;And it waits to be conquered. How is that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Marion turned to Dicksie. &#8220;You are not helping
a bit. What do you think?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think woman and trouble ought to be
associated even in figure; and I think &#8216;waits&#8217; is
horrid,&#8221; and Dicksie looked gravely at Whispering
Smith.</p>
<p>McCloud, too, looked at him. &#8220;You&#8217;re in
trouble now yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I brought it on myself. So we do seek
it, don&#8217;t we? And trouble, I must hold, <i>is</i> like
woman. &#8216;Waits&#8217; I strike out as unpleasantly suggestive;
let it go. So, then, trouble is like a lovely
woman, loveliest <i>when</i> conquered. Now, Miss
Dunning, if you have a spark of human kindness
you won&#8217;t turn me down on that proposition.
By the way, I have something put down about
trouble.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></div>
<p>He was laughing. Dicksie asked herself if this
could be the man about whom floated so many
accusations of coldness and cruelty and death. He
drew a note-book from a waistcoat pocket.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s in the note-book! There comes the
black note-book,&#8221; exclaimed McCloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t make fun of my note-book!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t dare.&#8221; McCloud pointed to it as
he spoke to Dicksie. &#8220;You should see what is in
that note-book: the record, I suppose, of every man
in the mountains and of a great many outside.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And countless other things,&#8221; added Marion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Such as what?&#8221; asked Dicksie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Such as you, for example,&#8221; said Marion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I a thing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A sweet thing, of course,&#8221; said Marion ironically.
&#8220;Yes, you; with color of eyes, hair, length
of index finger of the right hand, curvature of
thumb, disposition&ndash;&ndash;whether peaceable or otherwise,
and prison record, if any.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And number of your watch,&#8221; added McCloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;How dreadful!&#8221;</p>
<p>Whispering Smith eyed Dicksie benignly.
&#8220;They are talking this nonsense to distract us, of
course, but I am bound to read you what I have
here, if you will graciously submit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Submit? I <i>wait</i> to hear it,&#8221; laughed Dicksie.</p>
<p>&#8220;My training in prosody is the slightest, as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
will appear,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;and <i>synecdoche</i> and
<i>Schenectady</i> were always on the verge of getting
mixed when I went to school. My sentiment may
be termed obvious, but I want to offer a slight apology
on behalf of trouble; it is abused too much.
I submit this</p>

<p>&#8220;I have to say chorus. My verses don&#8217;t speak
for themselves, and no one would know it was a

<p>&#8220;Fine!&#8221; cried McCloud. &#8220;&#8216;Here&#8217;s to the
hearts that it brings us!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Dicksie threw back her head and laughed with
the others. Then Whispering Smith looked grave.
&#8220;There is a difficulty,&#8221; said he, knitting his brows.
&#8220;You have spoiled my song.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Smith, I hope not! Have I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your line is so much better than what I have
that it makes my stuff sound cheap.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, Gordon!&#8221; interposed McCloud.
&#8220;You don&#8217;t see that one reason why Miss Dunning&#8217;s
line sounds better than yours is owing to
the differences in your voices. If she will repeat
the chorus, finishing with her line, you will see the
difference.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Dunning, take the note-book,&#8221; begged
Whispering Smith.</p>
<p>&#8220;And rise, of course,&#8221; suggested McCloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the note-book! I shall be afraid to hold it.

<p>Whispering Smith rose before the applause subsided.
&#8220;I ask you to drink this, standing, in condensed
milk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have we enough to stand in?&#8221; interposed
Dicksie.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we stand together in trouble, that ought to
be enough,&#8221; observed McCloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re doing that without rising, aren&#8217;t we?&#8221;
asked Marion. &#8220;If we hadn&#8217;t been in trouble we
shouldn&#8217;t have ventured to this camp to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if you had not put me to the trouble of
following you&ndash;&ndash;and it was a lot of trouble!&ndash;&ndash;<i>I</i>
shouldn&#8217;t have been in camp to-night,&#8221; said Whispering
Smith.</p>
<p>&#8220;And if <i>I</i> had not been in trouble this camp
wouldn&#8217;t have been here to-night,&#8221; declared McCloud.
&#8220;What have we to thank for it all but
trouble?&#8221;</p>
<p>A voice called the superintendent&#8217;s name through
the tent door. &#8220;Mr. McCloud?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And there is more trouble,&#8221; added McCloud.
&#8220;What is it, Bill?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Twenty-eight and nine tenths on the gauge,
sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>McCloud looked at his companions. &#8220;I told
you so. Up three-tenths. Thank you, Bill; I&#8217;ll
be with you in a minute. Tell Cherry to come and
take away the supper things, will you? That is
about all the water we shall get to-night, I think.
It&#8217;s all we want,&#8221; added McCloud, glancing at his
watch. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to take a look at the river.
We shall be quiet now around here until half-past
three, and if you, Marion, and Miss Dunning will
take the tent, you can have two hours&#8217; rest before
we start. Bill Dancing will guard you against intrusion,
and if you want ice-water ring twice.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>A TALK WITH WHISPERING SMITH</h3>
</div>
<p>When Whispering Smith had followed McCloud
from the tent, Dicksie turned to
Marion and caught her hand. &#8220;Is this the terrible
man I have heard about?&#8221; she murmured. &#8220;And
I thought him ferocious! But is he as pitiless as
they say, Marion?&#8221;</p>
<p>Marion laughed&ndash;&ndash;a troubled little laugh of surprise
and sadness. &#8220;Dear, he isn&#8217;t pitiless at all.
He has unpleasant things to do, and does them.
He is the man on whom the railroad relies to repress
the lawlessness that breaks out in the mountains
at times and interferes with the operating
of the road. It frightens people away, and
prevents others from coming in to settle. Railroads
want law and order. Robbery and murders
don&#8217;t make business for railroads. They depend
on settlers for developing a country, don&#8217;t you
know; otherwise they would have no traffic, not
to speak of wanting their trains and men let alone.
When Mr. Bucks undertook to open up this country
to settlers, he needed a man of patience and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
endurance and with courage and skill in dealing
with lawless men, and no man has ever succeeded
so well as this terrible man you have heard about.
He is terrible, my dear, to lawless men, not to any
one else. He is terrible in resource and in daring,
but not in anything else I know of, and I knew him
when he was a boy and wore a big pink worsted
scarf when he went skating.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should like to have seen that scarf,&#8221; said
Dicksie reflectively. She rose and looked around
the tent. In a few minutes she made Marion lie
down on one of the cots. Then she walked to the
front of the tent, opened the flap, and looked out.</p>
<p>Whispering Smith was sitting before the fire.
Rain was falling, but Dicksie put on her close-fitting
black coat, raised the door-flap, and walked
noiselessly from the tent and up behind him.
&#8220;Alone in the rain?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>She had expected to see him start at her voice,
but he did not, though he rose and turned around.
&#8220;Not now,&#8221; he answered as he offered her his box
with a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you taking your hat off for me in the rain?
Put it on again!&#8221; she insisted with a little tone of
command, and she was conscious of gratification
when he obeyed amiably.</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t take your box unless you can find another!&#8221;
she said. &#8220;Oh, you have another! I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
came out to tell you what a dreadful man I thought
you were, and to apologize.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind apologizing. Lots of people
think worse than that of me and don&#8217;t apologize.
I&#8217;m sorry I have no shelter to offer you, except to
sit on this side and take the rain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should you take the rain for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But a stranger to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only in a way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dicksie gazed for a moment at the fire. &#8220;You
won&#8217;t think me abrupt, will you?&#8221; she said, turning
to him, &#8220;but, as truly as I live, I cannot account
for you, Mr. Smith. I guess at the ranch we don&#8217;t
know what goes on in the world. Everything I
see of you contradicts everything I have heard
of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t seen much of me yet, you know,
and you may have heard much better accounts of
me than I deserve. Still, it isn&#8217;t surprising you
can&#8217;t account for me; in fact, it would be surprising
if you could. Nobody pretends to do that. You
must not be shocked if I can&#8217;t even account for myself.
Do you know what a derelict is? A ship that
has been abandoned but never wholly sinks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t make fun of me! How did you
happen to come into the mountains? I do want to
understand things better.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Why, you are in real earnest, aren&#8217;t you?
But I am not making fun of you. Do you know
President Bucks? No? Too bad! He&#8217;s a very
handsome old bachelor. And he is one of those
men who get all sorts of men to do all sorts of
things for them. You know, building and operating
railroads in this part of the country is no
joke. The mountains are filled with men that
don&#8217;t care for God, man, or the devil. Sometimes
they furnish their own ammunition to fight with
and don&#8217;t bother the railroad for years; at such
times the railroad leaves them alone. For my
part, I never quarrel with a man that doesn&#8217;t
quarrel with the road. Then comes a time
when they get after us, shooting our men or robbing
our agents or stopping our trains. Of course
we have to get busy then. A few years ago they
worried Bucks till they nearly turned his hair gray.
At that unfortunate time I happened into his
office with a letter of introduction from his closest
Chicago friend, Willis Howard, prince of good
men, the man that made the Palmer House famous&ndash;&ndash;yes.
Now I had come out here, Miss Dunning&ndash;&ndash;I
almost said Miss Dicksie, because I hear it so
much&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should be greatly set up to hear you call
me Dicksie. And I have wondered a thousand
times about your name. Dare I ask&ndash;&ndash;<i>why</i> do
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
they call you Whispering Smith? You don&#8217;t
whisper.&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed with abundance of good-humor.
&#8220;That is a ridiculous accident, and it all came
about when I lived in Chicago. Do you know anything
about the infernal climate there? Well, in
Chicago I used to lose my voice whenever I caught
a cold&ndash;&ndash;sometimes for weeks together. So they
began calling me Whispering Smith, and I&#8217;ve never
been able to shake the name. Odd, isn&#8217;t it? But
I came out to go into the real-estate business. I
was looking for some gold-bearing farm lands
where I could raise quartz, don&#8217;t you know, and
such things&ndash;&ndash;yes. I don&#8217;t mind telling you this,
though I wouldn&#8217;t tell it to everybody&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly not,&#8221; assented Dicksie, drawing her
skirt around to sit in closer confidence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to get rich quick,&#8221; murmured Whispering
Smith, confidentially.</p>
<p>&#8220;Almost criminal, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to have evening clothes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And for once in my life two pairs of suspenders&ndash;&ndash;a
modest ambition, but a gnawing one.
Would you believe it? Before I left Bucks&#8217;s office
he had hired me for a railroad man. When he
asked me what I could do, and I admitted a little
experience in handling real estate, he brought his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
fist down on the table and swore I should be his
right-of-way man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How about the mining?&#8221;</p>
<p>Whispering Smith waved his hand in something
of the proud manner in which Bucks could wave
his presidential hand. &#8220;My business, Bucks said,
need not interfere with that, not in the least; he
said that I could do all the mining I wanted to, and
I <i>have</i> done all the mining I wanted to. But here
is the singular thing that happened: I opened up
my office and had nothing to do; they didn&#8217;t seem
to want any right of way just then. I kept getting
my check every month, and wasn&#8217;t doing a hand&#8217;s
turn but riding over the country and shooting jack-rabbits.
But, Lord, I love this country! Did you
know I used to be a cowboy in the mountains years
ago? Indeed I did. I know it almost as well as
you do. I mined more or less in the meantime.
Occasionally I would go to Bucks&ndash;&ndash;you say you
don&#8217;t know him?&ndash;&ndash;too bad!&ndash;&ndash;and tell him candidly
I wasn&#8217;t doing a thing to earn my salary. At
such times he would only ask me how I liked the
job,&#8221; and Whispering Smith&#8217;s heavy eyebrows rose
in mild surprise at the recollection. &#8220;One day
when I was talking with him he handed me a telegram
from the desert saying that a night operator
at a lonely station had been shot and a switch misplaced
and a train nearly wrecked. He asked me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
what I thought of it. I discovered that the poor
fellow had shot himself, and in the end we had to
put him in the insane asylum to save him from
the penitentiary&ndash;&ndash;but that was where my trouble
began.</p>
<p>&#8220;It ended in my having to organize the special
service on the whole road to look after a thousand
and one things that nobody else had&ndash;&ndash;well, let us
say time or inclination to look after: fraud and
theft and violence and all that sort of disagreeable
thing. Then one day the cat crawled out of the
bag. What do you think? That man who is now
president of this road had somewhere seen a highly
colored story about me in a magazine, a ten-cent
magazine, you know. He had spotted me the first
time I walked into his office, and told me a long
time afterward it was just like seeing a man walk
out of a book, and that he had hard work to keep
from falling on my neck. He knew what he wanted
me for; it was just this thing. I left Chicago to get
away from it, and this is the result. It is not all
that kind of thing, oh, no! When they want to
cross a reservation I have a winter in Washington
with our attorneys and dine with old friends in
the White House, and the next winter I may be
on snowshoes chasing a band of rustlers. I swore
long ago I would do no more of it&ndash;&ndash;that I couldn&#8217;t
and wouldn&#8217;t. But it is Bucks. I can&#8217;t go back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
on him. He is amiable and I am soft. He says
he is going to have a crown and harp for me some
day, but I fancy&ndash;&ndash;that is, I have an intimation&ndash;&ndash;that
there will be a red-hot protest at the bar of
Heaven,&#8221; he lowered his tone, &#8220;from a certain unmentionable
quarter when I undertake to put the
vestments on. By the way, I hear you are interested
in chickens. Oh, yes, I&#8217;ve heard a lot about
you! Bob Johnson, over at Oroville, has some
pretty bantams I want to tell you about.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whether he talked railroad or chickens, it was
all one: Dicksie sat spellbound; and when he announced
it was half-past three o&#8217;clock and time to
rouse Marion, she was amazed.</p>

SCENE FROM THE PHOTO-PLAY PRODUCTION OF &#8220;WHISPERING SMITH.&#8221; &copy; <i>American Mutual Studio</i>.<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></div>
<p>Dawn showed in the east. The men eating
breakfast in tents were to be sent on a work-train
up a piece of Y-track that led as near as they could
be taken to where they were needed. The train
had pulled out when Dicksie, Marion, McCloud,
and Whispering Smith took horses to get across to
the hills and through to the ranch-house. They
had ridden slowly for some distance when McCloud
was called back. The party returned and
rode together into the mists that hung below the
bridge. They came out upon a little party of men
standing with lanterns on a piece of track where
the river had taken the entire grade and raced furiously
through the gap. Fog shrouded the light of
the lanterns and lent gloom to the silence, but the
women could see the group that McCloud had
joined. Standing above his companions on a pile
of ties, a tall young man holding a megaphone
waited. Out of the darkness there came presently
a loud calling. The tall young man at intervals
bawled vigorously into the fog in answer. Far
away could be heard, in the intervals of silence,
the faint clang of the work-train engine-bell.
Again the voice came out of the fog. McCloud
took the megaphone and called repeatedly. Two
men rowed a boat out of the back-water behind
the grade, and when McCloud stepped into it, it
was released on a line while the oarsmen guided it
across the flood until it disappeared. The two
megaphone voices could still be heard. After a
time the boat was pulled back again, and McCloud
stepped out of it. He spoke a moment with the
men, rejoined his party, and climbed into the saddle.
&#8220;Now we are off,&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>&#8220;What was it all about?&#8221; asked Whispering
Smith.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your friend Klein is over there. Nobody
could understand what he said except that he
wanted me. When I got here I couldn&#8217;t make out
what he was talking about, so they let us out in
the boat on a line. Half-way across the break I
made out what was troubling him. He said he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
was going to lose three hundred feet of track, and
wanted to know what to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you told him, of course?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you tell him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I told him to lose it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I could have done that myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>AT THE RIVER</h3>
</div>
<p>They found the ranch-house as Marion and
Dicksie had left it, deserted. Puss told
them every one was at the river. McCloud did
not approve Dicksie&#8217;s plan of going down to
see her cousin first. &#8220;Why not let me ride down
and manage it without bringing you into it at all?&#8221;
he suggested. &#8220;It can be done.&#8221; And after further
discussion it was so arranged.</p>
<p>McCloud and Smith had been joined by Dancing
on horseback, and they made their way around
Squaw Lake and across the fields. The fog was
rolling up from the willows at the bend. Men were
chopping in the brush, and McCloud and his companion
soon met Lance Dunning riding up the narrow
strip of sand that held the river off the ranch.</p>
<p>McCloud greeted Dunning, regardless of his
amazement, as if he had parted from him the day
before. &#8220;How are you making it over here?&#8221;
he asked. &#8220;We are in pretty good shape at the
moment down below, and I thought I would ride
over to see if we could do anything for you. This
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
is what you call pretty fair water for this part of
the valley, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lance swallowed his astonishment. &#8220;This isn&#8217;t
water, McCloud; this is hell.&#8221; He took off his hat
and wiped his forehead. &#8220;Well, I call this white,
anyway, and no mistake&ndash;&ndash;I do indeed, sir! This
is Whispering Smith, isn&#8217;t it? Glad to see you at
Crawling Stone, sir.&#8221; Which served not only to
surprise but to please Whispering Smith.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of my men were free,&#8221; continued McCloud;
&#8220;I switched some mattresses and sacks
around the Y, thinking they might come in play
here for you at the bend. They are at your service
if you think you need them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Need them!&#8221; Lance swore fiercely and from
the bottom of his heart. He was glad to get help
from any quarter and made no bones about it.
Moreover, McCloud lessened the embarrassment
by explaining that he had a personal interest in
holding the channel where it ran, lest a change
above might threaten the approaches already built
to the bridge; and Whispering Smith, who would
have been on terms with the catfish if he had been
flung into the middle of the Crawling Stone, contributed
at once, like a re&euml;nforced spring, to the ease
of the situation.</p>
<p>Lance again took off his hat and wiped the sweat
of anxiety from his dripping forehead. &#8220;Whatever
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
differences of opinion I may have with your
damned company, I have no lack of esteem personally,
McCloud, for you, sir, by Heaven! How
many men did you bring?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And whatever wheels you Crawling Stone
ranchers may have in your heads on the subject of
irrigation,&#8221; returned McCloud evenly, &#8220;I have no
lack of esteem personally, Mr. Dunning, for you.
I brought a hundred.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want to take charge here? I&#8217;m frank,
sir; you understand this game and I don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose we look the situation over; meantime,
all our supplies have to be brought across from the
Y. What should you think, Mr. Dunning, of putting
all the teams you can at that end of the
work?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Every man that can be spared from the river
shall go at it. Come over here and look at our
work and judge for yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>They rode to where the forces assembled by
Lance were throwing up embankments and riprapping.
There was hurried running to and fro, a
violent dragging about of willows, and a good deal
of shouting.</p>
<p>Dunning, with some excitement, watched McCloud&#8217;s
face to note the effect of the activity on
him, but McCloud&#8217;s expression, naturally reserved,
reflected nothing of his views on the subject. Dunning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
waved his hand at the lively scene. &#8220;They&#8217;ve
been at it all night. How many would you take
away, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You might take them all away, as far as the
river is concerned,&#8221; said McCloud after a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;What? Hell! All?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are not doing anything, are they, but
running around in a circle? And those fellows over
there might as well be making mud pies as riprapping
at that point. What we need there is
a mattress and sandbags&ndash;&ndash;and plenty of them.
Bill,&#8221; directed McCloud in an even tone of business
as he turned to Dancing, &#8220;see how quick you
can get your gangs over here with what sacks they
can carry and walk fast. If you will put your men
on horses, Mr. Dunning, they can help like everything.
That bank won&#8217;t last a great while the
way the river is getting under it now.&#8221; Dancing
wheeled like an elephant on his bronco and clattered
away through the mud. Lance Dunning, recovering
from his surprise, started his men back for
the wagons, and McCloud, dismounting, walked
with him to the water&#8217;s edge to plan the fight for
what was left of the strip in front of the alfalfa
fields.</p>
<p>When Whispering Smith got back to the house
he was in good-humor. He joined Dicksie and
Marion in the dining-room, where they were drinking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
coffee. Afterward Dicksie ordered horses
saddled and the three rode to the river. Up and
down the bank as far as they could see in the misty
rain, men were moving slowly about&ndash;&ndash;more men,
it seemed to Dicksie, than she had ever seen together
in her life. The confusion and the noise
had disappeared. No one appeared to hurry, but
every one had something to do, and, from the
gangs who with sledges were sinking &#8220;dead-men&#8221;
among the trees to hold the cables of the mattress
that was about to be sunk, and the Japs who were
diligently preparing to float and load it, to the men
that were filling and wheeling the sandbags, no
one appeared excited. McCloud joined the visitors
for a few moments and then went back to
where Dancing and his men on life-lines were
guiding the mattress to its resting-place. In spite
of the gloom of the rain, which Whispering Smith
said was breaking, Dicksie rode back to the house
in much better spirits with her two guests; and when
they came from luncheon the sun, as Smith had predicted,
was shining.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, come out!&#8221; cried Dicksie, at the door.
Marion had a letter to write and went upstairs,
but Whispering Smith followed Dicksie. &#8220;Does
everything you say come true?&#8221; she demanded as
she stood in the sunshine.</p>
<p>She was demure with light-heartedness and he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
looked at her approvingly. &#8220;I hope nothing I may
say ever will come true unless it makes you happy,&#8221;
he answered lightly. &#8220;It would be a shame if it
did anything else.&#8221;</p>
<p>She pointed two accusing fingers at him. &#8220;Do
you know what you promised last night? You
have forgotten already! You said you would tell
me why my leghorns are eating their feathers off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me talk with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just what I should like. Come on!&#8221; said Dicksie,
leading the way to the chicken-yard. &#8220;I want
you to see my bantams too. I have three of the
dearest little things. One is setting. They are over
the way. Come see them first. And, oh, you must
see my new game chickens. Truly, you never saw
anything as handsome as C&aelig;sar&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;s the rooster;
and I have six pullets. C&aelig;sar is perfectly superb.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the two reached the chicken-houses Dicksie
examined the nest where she was setting the bantam
hen. &#8220;This miserable hen will not set,&#8221; she
exclaimed in despair. &#8220;See here, Mr. Smith, she
has left her nest again and is scratching around on
the ground. Isn&#8217;t it a shame? I&#8217;ve tied a cord
around her leg so she couldn&#8217;t run away, and she
is hobbling around like a scrub pony.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps the eggs are too warm,&#8221; suggested
her companion. &#8220;I have had great success in
cases like this with powdered ice&ndash;&ndash;not using too
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
much, of course; just shave the ice gently and rub
it over the eggs one at a time; it will often result
in refreshing the attention of the hen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dicksie looked grave. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you ashamed
to make fun of me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Whispering Smith seemed taken aback. &#8220;Is it
really serious business?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good. Let me watch this hen for a few
minutes and diagnose her. You go on to your
other chickens. I&#8217;ll stay here and think.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dicksie went down through the yards. When
she came back, Whispering Smith was sitting on a
cracker-box watching the bantam. The chicken
was making desperate efforts to get off Dicksie&#8217;s
cord and join its companions in the runway.
Smith was eying the bantam critically when Dicksie
rejoined him. &#8220;Do you usually,&#8221; he asked,
looking suddenly up, &#8220;have success in setting
roosters?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you are having fun with me again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, by Heaven! I am not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you diagnosed the case?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have, and I have diagnosed it as a case of
mistaken identity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Identity?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And misapplied energy. Miss Dicksie, you
have tied up the wrong bird. This is not a bantam
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
hen at all; this is a bantam rooster. Now that
is <i>my</i> judgment. Compare him with the others.
Notice how much darker his plumage is&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s
the rooster,&#8221; declared Whispering Smith, wiping
the perplexity from his brow. &#8220;Don&#8217;t feel bad,
not at all. Cut him loose, Miss Dicksie&ndash;&ndash;don&#8217;t
hesitate; do it on my responsibility. Now let&#8217;s
look at the cannibal leghorns&ndash;&ndash;and great C&aelig;sar.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>BETWEEN GIRLHOOD AND WOMANHOOD</h3>
</div>
<p>About nine o&#8217;clock that night Puss ushered
McCloud in from the river. Dicksie came
running downstairs to meet him. &#8220;Your cousin
insisted I should come up to the house for some
supper,&#8221; said McCloud dryly. &#8220;I could have
taken camp fare with the men. Gordon stayed
there with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dicksie held his hat in her hand, and her eyes
were bright in the firelight. Puss must have
thought the two made a handsome couple, for she
lingered, as she started for the kitchen, to look
back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Puss,&#8221; exclaimed her mistress, &#8220;fry a chicken
right away! A big one, Puss! Mr. McCloud is
very hungry, I know. And be quick, do! Oh,
how is the river, Mr. McCloud?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Behaving like a lamb. It hasn&#8217;t fallen much,
but the pressure seems to be off the bank, if you
know what that means?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must be a magician! Things changed the
minute you came!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span></div>
<p>&#8220;The last doctor usually gets credit for the
cure, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I know all about that. Don&#8217;t you want
to freshen up? Should you mind coming right to
my room? Marion is in hers,&#8221; explained Dicksie,
&#8220;and I am never sure of Cousin Lance&#8217;s,&ndash;&ndash;he has
so many boots.&#8221;</p>
<p>When she had disposed of McCloud she flew
to the kitchen. Puss was starting after a chicken.
&#8220;Take a lantern, Puss!&#8221; whispered Dicksie vehemently.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, indeed; dis nigger don&#8217; need no lantern
fo&#8217; chickens, Miss Dicksie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But get a good one, Puss, and make haste,
do! Mr. McCloud must be starved! Where is
the baking powder? I&#8217;ll get the biscuits started.&#8221;</p>
<p>Puss turned fiercely. &#8220;Now look-a heah, yo&#8217;
can&#8217;t make biscuits! Yo&#8217; jes&#8217; go se&#8217; down wif dat
young gen&#8217;m&#8217;n! Jes&#8217; lemme lone, ef yo&#8217; please!
Dis ain&#8217;t de firs&#8217; time I killed chickens, Miss Dicksie,
an&#8217; made biscuits. Jes&#8217; clair out an&#8217; se&#8217; down!
Place f&#8217;r young ladies is in de parlor! Ol&#8217; Puss
can cook supper f&#8217;r one man yet&ndash;&ndash;ef she <i>has</i> to!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, Puss, certainly, I know, of course;
only, get a nice chicken!&#8221; and with the parting
admonition Dicksie, smoothing her hair wildly,
hastened back to the living-room.</p>
<p>But the harm was done. Puss, more excited
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
than her mistress, lost her head when she got to
the chicken-yard, and with sufficiently bad results.
When Dicksie ran out a few moments afterward
for a glass of water for McCloud, Puss was calmly
wiping her hands, and in the sink lay the quivering
form of young C&aelig;sar. Dicksie caught her favorite
up by the legs and suppressed a cry. There
could be no mistake. She cast a burning look on
Puss. It would do no good to storm now. Dicksie
only wrung her hands and returned to McCloud.</p>
<p>He rose in the happiest mood. He could not
see what a torment Dicksie was in, and took the
water without asking himself why it trembled in
her hand. Her restrained manner did not worry
him, for he felt that his fight at the river was won,
and the prospect of fried chicken composed him.
Even the long hour before Puss, calm and inviting
in a white cap and apron, appeared to announce
supper, passed like a dream. When Dicksie rose
to lead the way to the dining-room, McCloud
walked on air; the high color about her eyes intoxicated
him. Not till half the fried chicken,
with many compliments from McCloud, had disappeared,
and the plate had gone out for the
second dozen biscuits, did he notice Dicksie&#8217;s
abstraction.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you need worry no longer about the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
water,&#8221; he observed reassuringly. &#8220;I think the
worst of the danger is past.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dicksie looked at the table-cloth with wide-open
eyes. &#8220;I feel sure that it is. I am no longer
worrying about that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing I can do or leave undone, is it?&#8221;
asked McCloud, laughing a little as he implied in
his tone that she must be worrying about something.</p>
<p>Dicksie made a gesture of alarm. &#8220;Oh, no, no;
nothing!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pretty good plan not to worry about
anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, we all thought so last night. Heavens!&#8221;
McCloud drew back in his chair. &#8220;I
never offered you a piece of chicken! What have
I been thinking of?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I wouldn&#8217;t eat it anyway!&#8221; cried Dicksie.</p>
<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t? It is delicious. Do have a
plate and a wing at least.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Really, I could not bear to think of it,&#8221; she
said pathetically.</p>
<p>He spoke lower. &#8220;Something is troubling you.
I have no right to a confidence, I know,&#8221; he added,
taking a biscuit.</p>
<p>Her eyes fell to the floor. &#8220;It is nothing. Pray,
don&#8217;t mind me. May I fill your cup?&#8221; she asked,
looking up. &#8220;I am afraid I worry too much over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
what has happened and can&#8217;t be helped. Do you
never do that?&#8221;</p>
<p>McCloud, laughing wretchedly, tore C&aelig;sar&#8217;s
last leg from his body. &#8220;No indeed. I never
worry over what can&#8217;t be helped.&#8221;</p>
<p>They left the dining-room. Marion came down.
But they had hardly seated themselves before the
living-room fire when a messenger arrived with
word that McCloud was wanted at the river. His
chagrin at being dragged away was so apparent
that Marion and Dicksie sympathized with him
and laughed at him. &#8220;&#8216;I never worry about
what can&#8217;t be helped,&#8217;&#8221; Dicksie murmured.</p>
<p>He looked at Marion. &#8220;That&#8217;s a shot at me.
You don&#8217;t want to go down, do you?&#8221; he asked
ironically, looking from one to the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, of course I&#8217;ll go down,&#8221; responded
Dicksie promptly. &#8220;Marion caught cold last
night, I guess, so you will excuse her, I know. I
will be back in an hour, Marion, and you can
toast your cold while I&#8217;m gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you mustn&#8217;t go alone!&#8221; protested McCloud.</p>
<p>Dicksie lifted her chin the least bit. &#8220;I shall
be going with you, shall I not? And if the messenger
has gone back I shall have to guide you.
You never could find your way alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I can go,&#8221; interposed Marion, rising.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Not at all; you can <i>not</i> go!&#8221; announced Dicksie.
&#8220;I can protect both Mr. McCloud and myself.
If he should arrive down there under the
wing of two women he would never hear the last
of it. I am mistress here still, I think; and I
sha&#8217;n&#8217;t be leaving home, you know, to make the
trip!&#8221;</p>
<p>McCloud looked at Marion. &#8220;I never worry
over what can&#8217;t be helped&ndash;&ndash;though it is dollars to
cents that those fellows don&#8217;t need me down there
any more than a cat needs two tails. And how
will you get back?&#8221; he asked, turning to Dicksie.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will ride back!&#8221; returned Dicksie loftily.
&#8220;But you may, if you like, help me get my horse
up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure you can find your way back?&#8221;
persisted McCloud.</p>
<p>Dicksie looked at him in surprise. &#8220;Find my
way back?&#8221; she echoed softly. &#8220;I could not
lose it. I can ride over any part of this country
at noon or at midnight, asleep or awake, with a
saddle or without, with a bridle or without, with
a trail or without. I&#8217;ve ridden every horse that
has ever come on the Crawling Stone Ranch. I
could ride when I was three years old. Find my
way back?&#8221;</p>
<p>The messenger had gone when the two rode
from the house. The sky was heavily overcast,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
and the wind blew such a gale from the south and
west that one could hardly hear what the other
said. McCloud could not have ridden from the
house to the barn in the utter darkness, but his
horse followed Dicksie&#8217;s. She halted frequently
on the trail for him to come up with her, and after
they had crossed the alfalfa fields McCloud did
not care whether they ever found the path again or
not. &#8220;It&#8217;s great, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; he exclaimed, coming
up to her after opening a gate in the dark.
&#8220;Where are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This way,&#8221; laughed Dicksie. &#8220;Look out for
the trail here. Give me your hand and let your
horse have his head. If he slips, drop off quick on
this side.&#8221; McCloud caught her hand. They
rode for a moment in silence, the horses stepping
cautiously. &#8220;All right now,&#8221; said Dicksie; &#8220;you
may let go.&#8221; But McCloud kept his horse up
close and clung to the warm hand. &#8220;The camp
is just around the hill,&#8221; murmured Dicksie, trying
to pull away. &#8220;But of course if you would like
to ride in holding my hand you may!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said McCloud, &#8220;of course not&ndash;&ndash;not for
worlds! But, Miss Dicksie, couldn&#8217;t we ride back
to the house and ride around the other way into
camp? I think the other way into the camp&ndash;&ndash;say,
around by the railroad bridge&ndash;&ndash;would be prettier,
don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span></div>
<p>For answer she touched Jim lightly with her
lines and his spring released her hand very effectively.
As she did so the trail turned, and the
camp-fire, whipped in the high wind, blazed before
them.</p>
<p>Whispering Smith and Lance Dunning were
sitting together as the two galloped up. Smith
helped Dicksie to alight. She was conscious of her
color and that her eyes were now unduly bright.
Moreover, Whispering Smith&#8217;s glance rested so
calmly on both McCloud&#8217;s face and her own that
Dicksie felt as if he saw quite through her and
knew everything that had happened since they left
the house.</p>
<p>Lance was talking to McCloud. &#8220;Don&#8217;t abuse
the wind,&#8221; McCloud was saying. &#8220;It&#8217;s our best
friend to-night, Mr. Dunning. It is blowing the
water off-shore. Where is the trouble?&#8221; For
answer Dunning led McCloud off toward the
Bend, and Dicksie was left alone with Whispering
Smith.</p>
<p>He made a seat for her on the windward side
of the big fire. When she had seated herself she
looked up in great contentment to ask if he was
not going to sit down beside her. The brown
coat, the high black hat, and the big eyes of Whispering
Smith had already become a part of her
mental store. She saw that he seemed preoccupied,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
and sought to draw him out of his abstraction.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am so glad you and Mr. McCloud are getting
acquainted with Cousin Lance,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;And do you mind my giving you a confidence,
Mr. Smith? Lance has been so unreasonable
about this matter of the railroad&#8217;s coming up
the valley and powwowing so much with lawyers
and ranchers that he has been forgetting about
everything at home. He is so much older than I
am that he ought to be the sensible one of the family,
don&#8217;t you think so? It frightens me to have
him losing at cards and drinking. I am afraid he
will get into some shooting affair. I don&#8217;t understand
what has come over him, and I worry about
it. I believe you could influence him if you knew
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes you think that?&#8221; asked Whispering
Smith, but his eyes were on the fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because these men he spends his time with in
town&ndash;&ndash;the men who fight and shoot so much&ndash;&ndash;are
afraid of you. Don&#8217;t laugh at me. I know it is
quite true in spite of their talk. I was afraid of
you myself until&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Until we made verse together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Until you made verse and I spoiled it. But
I think it is because I don&#8217;t understand things
that I am so afraid. I am not naturally a coward.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
I&#8217;m sure I could not be afraid of you if I understood
things better. And there is Marion. She
puzzles me. She will never speak of her husband&ndash;&ndash;I
don&#8217;t know why. And I don&#8217;t know why Mr.
McCloud is so hard on Mr. Sinclair&ndash;&ndash;Mr. Sinclair
seems so kind and good-natured.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whispering Smith looked from the fire into
Dicksie&#8217;s eyes. &#8220;What should you say if I gave
you a confidence?&#8221;</p>
<p>She opened her heart to his searching gaze.
&#8220;Would you trust me with a confidence?&#8221;</p>
<p>He answered without hesitation. &#8220;You shall
see. Now, I have many things I can&#8217;t talk about,
you understand. But if I had to give you a secret
this instant that carried my life, I shouldn&#8217;t fear to
do it&ndash;&ndash;so much for trusting you. Only this, too,
as to what I say: don&#8217;t ever quote me or let it
appear that you any more than know me. Can you
manage that? Really? Very good; you will
understand why in a minute. The man that is
stirring up all this trouble with your Cousin Lance
and in this whole country is your kind and good-natured
neighbor, Mr. Sinclair. I am prejudiced
against him; let us admit that on the start, and
remember it in estimating what I say. But Sinclair
is the man who has turned your cousin&#8217;s head,
as well as made things in other ways unpleasant
for several of us. Sinclair&ndash;&ndash;I tell you so you will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
understand everything, more than your cousin,
Mr. McCloud, or Marion Sinclair understand&ndash;&ndash;Sinclair
is a train-wrecker and a murderer. That
makes you breathe hard, doesn&#8217;t it? but it is
so. Sinclair is fairly educated and highly intelligent,
capable in every way, daring to the limit,
and, in a way, fascinating; it is no wonder he has a
following. But his following is divided into two
classes: the men that know all the secrets, and the
men that don&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;men like Rebstock and Du Sang,
and men like your cousin and a hundred or so
sports in Medicine Bend, who see only the glamour
of Sinclair&#8217;s pace. Your cousin sympathizes
with Sinclair when he doesn&#8217;t actually side with
him. All this has helped to turn Sinclair&#8217;s head,
and this is exactly the situation you and McCloud
and I and a lot of others are up against. They
don&#8217;t know all this, but I know it, and now you
know it. Let me tell you something that comes
close to home. You have a cowboy on the ranch
named Karg&ndash;&ndash;he is called Flat Nose. Karg was a
railroad man. He is a cattle-thief, a train-robber,
a murderer, and a spy. I should not tell you this
if you were not game to the last drop of your
blood. But I think I know you better than you
know yourself, though you never saw me until
last night. Karg is Sinclair&#8217;s spy at your ranch,
and you must never feel it or know it; but he is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
there to keep your cousin&#8217;s sympathy with Sinclair,
and to lure your cousin his way. And Karg will
try to kill George McCloud every time he sets foot
on this ranch, remember that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then Mr. McCloud ought not to be here. I
don&#8217;t want him to stay if he is in danger!&#8221; exclaimed
Dicksie.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I do want him to come here as if it mattered
nothing, and I shall try to take care of him.
I have a man among your own men, a cowboy
named Wickwire, who will be watching Karg, and
who is just as quick, and Karg, not knowing he was
watched, would be taken unawares. If Wickwire
goes elsewhere to work some one else will take his
place here. Karg is not on the ranch now; he
is up North, hunting up some of your steers that
were run off last month by his own cronies. Now
do you think I am giving you confidence?&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at him steadily. &#8220;If I can only deserve
it all.&#8221; In the distance she heard the calling
of the men at the river borne on the wind. The
shock of what had been told her, the strangeness
of the night and of the scene, left her calm. Fear
had given way to responsibility and Dicksie seemed
to know herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have nothing whatever to do to deserve
it but keep your own counsel. But listen a moment
longer&ndash;&ndash;for this is what I have been leading up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
to,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Marion will get a message to-morrow,
a message from Sinclair, asking her to
come to see him at his ranch-house before she goes
back. I don&#8217;t know what he wants&ndash;&ndash;but she is
his wife. He has treated her infamously; that is
why she will not live with him and does not speak
of him. But you know how strange a woman is&ndash;&ndash;or
perhaps you don&#8217;t: she doesn&#8217;t always cease to
care for a man when she ceases to trust him. I
am not in Marion&#8217;s confidence, Miss Dicksie. She
is another man&#8217;s wife. I cannot tell how she feels
toward him; I know she has often tried to reclaim
him from his deviltry. She may try again, that is,
she may, for one reason or another, go to him as
he asks. I could not interfere, if I would. I have
no right to if I could, and I will not. Now this is
what I&#8217;m trying to get up the courage to ask you.
Should you dare to go with her to Sinclair&#8217;s ranch
if she decides to go to him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly I should dare.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;After all you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;After all I know&ndash;&ndash;why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then in case she does go and you go with her,
you will know nothing whatever about anything, of
course, unless you get the story from her. What I
fear is that which possibly may come of their interview.
He may try to kill her&ndash;&ndash;don&#8217;t be frightened.
He will not succeed if you can only make
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
sure he doesn&#8217;t lead her away on horseback from
the ranch-house or get her alone in a room. She
has few friends. I respect and honor her because
she and I grew up as children together in the
same little town in Wisconsin. I know her folks,
all of them, and I&#8217;ve promised them&ndash;&ndash;you know&ndash;&ndash;to
have a kind of care of her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked self-conscious even at her tone of
understanding. &#8220;I need not try to deceive you;
your instinct would be poor if it did not tell you
more than I ought to. He came along and turned
her head. You need fear nothing for yourself in
going with her, and nothing for her if you can
cover just those two points&ndash;&ndash;can you remember?
Not to let her go away with him on horseback, and
not to leave her where she will be alone with him
in the house?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can and will. I think as much of Marion as
you do. I am proud to be able to do something
for you. How little I have known you! I
thought you were everything I didn&#8217;t want to
know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing,&#8221; he returned easily, &#8220;except that
Sinclair has stirred up your cousin and the ranchers
as well as the Williams Cache gang, and that
makes talk about me. I have to do what I can to
make this a peaceable country to live in. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
railroad wants decent people here and doesn&#8217;t want
the other kind, and it falls on me, unfortunately,
to keep the other kind moving. I don&#8217;t like it,
but we can none of us do quite what we please in
making a living. Let me tell you this&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;he turned
to fix his eyes seriously on hers: &#8220;Believe anything
you hear of me except that I have ever taken
human life willingly or save in discharge of my
duty. But this kind of work makes my own life an
uncertainty, as you can see. I do almost literally
carry my life in my hand, for if my hand is not
quicker every time than a man&#8217;s eye, I am done
for then and there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is dreadful to think of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not exactly that, but it is something I can&#8217;t
afford to forget.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What would become of the lives of the friends
you protect if you were killed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You say you care for Marion Sinclair. I
should like to think if anything should happen to
me you wouldn&#8217;t forget her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never will.&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled. &#8220;Then I put her in charge of the
man closest to me, George McCloud, and the
woman she thinks the most of in the world&ndash;&ndash;except
her mother. What is this, are they back?
Yonder they come.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We found nothing serious,&#8221; McCloud said,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
answering their questions as he approached with
Lance Dunning. &#8220;The current is really swinging
away, but the bank is caving in where it was undermined
last night.&#8221; He stopped before Dicksie.
&#8220;I am trying to get your cousin to go to the house
and go to bed. I am going to stay all night, but
there is no necessity for his staying.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn it, McCloud, it&#8217;s not right,&#8221; protested
Lance, taking off his hat and wiping his forehead.
&#8220;You need the sleep more than I do. I say he is
the one to go to bed to-night,&#8221; continued Lance,
putting it up to Whispering Smith. &#8220;And I insist,
by the Almighty, that you two take him back to
the house with you now!&#8221;</p>
<p>Whispering Smith raised his hand. &#8220;If this is
merely a family quarrel about who shall go to bed,
let us compromise. You two stay up all night and
let me go to bed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lance, however, was obdurate.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to be a family characteristic of the
Dunnings to have their own way,&#8221; ventured McCloud,
after some further dispute. &#8220;If you will
have it so, Mr. Dunning, you may stand watch
to-night and I will go to the house.&#8221;</p>
<p>Riding back with McCloud, Dicksie and Whispering
Smith discussed the flood. McCloud disclaimed
credit for the improvement in the situation.
&#8220;If the current had held against us as it did yesterday,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
nothing I could have done would have
turned it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Honesty is the best policy, of course,&#8221; observed
Whispering Smith. &#8220;I like to see a modest man&ndash;&ndash;and
you want to remind him of all this when he
sends in his bill,&#8221; he suggested, speaking to Dicksie
in the dark. &#8220;But,&#8221; he added, turning to
McCloud, &#8220;admitting that you are right, don&#8217;t
take the trouble to advertise your view of it
around here. It would be only decent strategy for
us in the valley just now to take a little of the
credit due to the wind.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>THE MAN ON THE FRENCHMAN</h3>
</div>
<p>Sinclair&#8217;s place on the Frenchman backed
up on a sharp rise against the foothills of
the Bridger range, and the ranch buildings were
strung along the creek. The ranch-house stood
on ground high enough to command the country
for miles up and down the valley.</p>
<p>Only two roads lead from Medicine Bend and
the south into the Frenchman country: one a
wagon-road following Smoky Creek and running
through Dale Canyon; the other a pack-road,
known as the Gridley trail, crossing the Topah
Topah Hills and making a short cut from the Dunning
ranch on the Crawling Stone to the Frenchman.
The entire valley is, in fact, so difficult of
access, save by the long and roundabout wagon-road,
that the sight of a complete outfit of buildings
such as that put up by Sinclair always came
as a surprise to the traveller who, reaching the
crest of the hills, looked suddenly down a thousand
feet on his well-ordered sheds and barns and corrals.</p>
<p>The rider who reaches the Topah Topah crest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
on the Gridley trail now sees in the valley below
only traces of what was so laboriously planned and
perfectly maintained a few years ago. But even
the ruins left on the Frenchman show the herculean
labor undertaken by the man in setting up
a comfortable and even an elaborate establishment
in so inaccessible a spot. His defiance of all ordinary
means of doing things was shown in his preference
for bringing much of his building-material
over the trail instead of around by the Smoky
Creek road. A good part of the lumber that went
into his house was packed over the Gridley trail.
His piano was brought through the canyon on a
wagon, but the mechanical player for the piano
and his wagons themselves were packed over the
trail on the backs of mules. A heavy steel range
for the kitchen had been brought over the same
way. For Sinclair no work was hard enough,
none went fast enough, and revelry never rose high
enough. During the time of his activity in the
Frenchman Valley Sinclair had the best-appointed
place between Williams Cache and the Crawling
Stone, and in the Crawling Stone only the Dunning
ranch would bear comparison with his own.
On the Frenchman Sinclair kept an establishment
the fame of which is still foremost in mountain
story. Here his cows ranged the canyons and the
hills for miles, and his horses were known from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
Medicine Bend to Fort Tracy. Here he rallied
his men, laid snares for his enemies, dispensed a
reckless hospitality, ruled his men with an oath and
a blow, and carried a six-shooter to explain orders
and answer questions with.</p>
<p>Over the Gridley trail from the Crawling Stone
Marion and Dicksie Dunning rode early in the
morning the day after McCloud and his men left
the Stone Ranch with their work done. The trail
is a good three hours long, and they reached Sinclair&#8217;s
place at about ten o&#8217;clock. He was waiting
for Marion&ndash;&ndash;she had sent word she should
come&ndash;&ndash;and he came out of the front door into the
sunshine with a smile of welcome when he saw
Dicksie with her. Dicksie, long an admirer of Sinclair&#8217;s,
as women usually were, had recast somewhat
violently her opinions of him. She faced him
now with a criminal consciousness that she knew
too much. The weight of the dreadful secret
weighed on her, and her responsibility in the issue
of the day ahead did not help to make her greeting
an easy one. One thing only was fixed in her
mind and reflected in the tension of her lips and
her eyes: the resolve to keep at every cost the
promise she had given. For Dicksie had fallen
under the spell of a man even more compelling
than Sinclair, and felt strangely bounden to what
she had said.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></div>
<p>Sinclair, however, had spirit enough to smooth
quite away every embarrassment. &#8220;Bachelor&#8217;s
quarters,&#8221; he explained roughly and pleasantly, as
he led the two women toward the house. &#8220;Cowmen
make poor housekeepers, but you must feel at
home.&#8221; And when Dicksie, looking at his Indian
rugs on the floors, the walls, and the couches, said
she thought he had little to apologize for, Sinclair
looked gratified and took off his hat again. &#8220;Just
a moment,&#8221; he said, standing at the side of the
door. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never been able to get Marion over
here before, so it happens that a woman&#8217;s foot has
never entered the new house. I want to watch
one of you cross the threshold for the first time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dicksie, moving ahead, retreated with a laugh.
&#8220;You first, then, Marion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Dicksie, you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never! you first.&#8221; So Marion, quite red and
wretchedly ill at ease, walked into the ranch-house
first.</p>
<p>Sinclair shone nowhere better than as a host.
When he had placed his guests comfortably in the
living-room he told them the story of the building
of the house. Then he made a cicerone of
himself, and explained, with running comments,
each feature of his plan as he showed how it had
been carried out through the various rooms. Surprised
at the attractiveness of things, Dicksie found
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
herself making mental notes for her own use,
and began asking questions. Sinclair was superb
in answering, but the danger of admiring things
became at once apparent, for when Dicksie exclaimed
over a handsome bearskin, a rich dark
brown grizzly-skin of unusual size, Sinclair told
the story of the killing, bared his tremendous forearm
to show where the polished claws had ripped
him, and, disregarding Dicksie&#8217;s protests, insisted
on sending the skin over to Crawling Stone Ranch
as a souvenir of her visit.</p>
<p>&#8220;I live a great deal alone over here,&#8221; he said,
waving Dicksie&#8217;s continued refusal magnificently
aside as he moved into the next room. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got
a few good dogs, and I hunt just enough to keep
my hand in with a rifle.&#8221; Dicksie quailed a little
at the smile that went with the words. &#8220;The
men, at least the kind I mix with, don&#8217;t care for
grizzly-skins, and to enjoy anything you&#8217;ve got
to have sympathetic company&ndash;&ndash;don&#8217;t you know
that?&#8221; he asked, looking admiringly at Dicksie.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve got another skin for you&ndash;&ndash;a silver-tip,&#8221; he
added in deep, gentle tones, addressing Marion.
&#8220;It has a fine head, as fine as I ever saw in the
Smithsonian. It is down at Medicine Bend now,
being dressed and mounted. By the way, I&#8217;ve forgotten
to ask you, Miss Dicksie, about the high
water. How did you get through at the ranch?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span></div>
<p>Dicksie, sitting on the piano-bench, looked up
with resolution. &#8220;Bravely!&#8221; she exclaimed.
&#8220;Mr. McCloud came to our rescue with bags and
mattresses and a hundred men, and he has put in
a revetement a thousand feet long. Oh, we are
regular river experts at our house now! Had you
any trouble here, Mr. Sinclair?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, the Frenchman behaves pretty well in the
rock. We had forty feet of water here one day,
though; forty feet, that&#8217;s right. McCloud, yes;
able fellow, I guess, too, though he and I don&#8217;t hit
it off.&#8221; Sinclair sat back in his chair, and as he
spoke he spoke magnanimously. &#8220;He doesn&#8217;t like
me, but that is no fault of his; railroad men, and
good ones, too, sometimes get started wrong with
one another. Well, I&#8217;m glad he took care of you.
Try that piano, Miss Dicksie, will you? I don&#8217;t
know much about pianos, but that ought to be a
good one. I would wheel the player over for you,
but any one that plays as beautifully as you do
ought not to be allowed to use a player. Marion,
I want to talk a few minutes with you,
may I? Do you mind going out under the cottonwood?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dicksie&#8217;s heart jumped. &#8220;Don&#8217;t be gone long,
Marion,&#8221; she exclaimed impulsively, &#8220;for you
know, Mr. Sinclair, we <i>must</i> get back by two
o&#8217;clock.&#8221; And Dicksie, pale with apprehension,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
looked at them both. Marion, quite composed,
nodded reassuringly and followed Sinclair out of
doors into the sunshine.</p>
<p>For a few minutes Dicksie fingered wildly on
the piano at some half-forgotten air, and in a fever
of excitement walked out on the porch to see where
they were. To her relief, she saw Marion sitting
near Sinclair under the big tree in front of the
house, where the horses stood. Dicksie, with her
hands on her girdle, walked forlornly back and
forth, hummed a tune, sat down in a rocking-chair,
fanned herself, rose, walked back and forth again,
and reflected that she was perfectly helpless, and
that Sinclair might kill Marion a hundred times
before she could reach her. And the thought that
Marion was perhaps wholly unconscious of danger
increased her anxiety.</p>
<p>She sat down in despair. How could Whispering
Smith have allowed any one he had a care for
to be exposed in this dreadful way? Trying to
think what to do, Dicksie hurried back into the
living-room, walked to the piano, took the pile of
sheet-music from the top, and sat down to thumb
it over. She threw song after song on the chair
beside her. They were sheets of gaudy coon songs
and ragtime with flaring covers, and they seemed
to give off odors of cheap perfume. Dicksie hardly
saw the titles as she passed them over, but of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
sudden she stopped. Between two sheets of the
music lay a small handkerchief. It was mussed,
and in the corner of it &#8220;Nellie&#8221; was written conspicuously
in a laundry mark. The odor of musk
became in an instant sickening. Dicksie threw the
music disdainfully aside, and sprang up with a
flushed face to leave the room. Sinclair&#8217;s remark
about the first woman to cross his threshold came
back to her. From that moment Dicksie hated
him. But no sooner had she seated herself on
the porch than she remembered she had left her
hat in the house, and rose to go in after it. She
was resolved not to leave it under the roof another
moment, and she had resolved to go over and wait
where her horse was tied. As she re&euml;ntered the
doorway she stopped. In the room she had just
left a cowboy sat at the table, taking apart a revolver
to clean it. The revolver was spread in its
parts before him, but across the table lay a rifle.
The man had not been in the room when she left
it a moment before.</p>
<p>Dicksie passed behind him. He paid no attention
to her; he had not looked up when she entered
the room. Passing behind him once more to go
out, Dicksie looked through the open window before
which he sat. Sinclair and Marion sitting
under the cottonwood tree were in plain sight, and
the muzzle of the rifle where it lay covered them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
Dicksie thrilled, but the man was busy with his
work. Breathing deeply, she walked out on the
porch again. Sinclair, she thought, was looking
straight at her, and in her anxiety to appear unconscious
she turned, walked to the end of the house,
and at the corner almost ran into a man sitting
out of doors in the shade mending a saddle. He
had removed his belt to work, and his revolver lay
in the holster on the bench, its grip just within
reach of his hand. Dicksie walked in front of him,
but he did not look up. She turned as if changing
her mind, and with a little flirt of her riding-skirt
sat down in the porch chair, feeling a faint
moisture upon her forehead.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&#8220;I am going to leave this country, Marion,&#8221;
Sinclair was saying. &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing here for
me; I can see that. What&#8217;s the use of my eating
my heart out over the way I&#8217;ve been treated? I&#8217;ve
given the best years of my life to this railroad,
and now they turn me down with a kick and a
curse. It&#8217;s the old story of the Indian and his
dog, only I don&#8217;t propose to let them make soup
of me. I&#8217;m going to the coast, Marion. I&#8217;m
going to California, where I wanted to go when
we were married, and I wish to God we had gone
there then. All our troubles might never have
been if I had got in with a different crowd from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
these cow-boozers on the start. And, Marion, I
want to know whether you&#8217;ll give me another
chance and go with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sinclair, on the bench and leaning against the
tree, sat with folded arms looking at his wife.
Marion in a hickory chair faced him.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one would like to see you be all you ought
to be more than I, Murray; but you are the only
one in the world that can ever give yourself another
chance to be that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The fellows in the saddle here now have denied
me every chance to make a man of myself
again on the railroad&ndash;&ndash;you know that, Marion.
In fact, they never did give me the show I was
entitled to. I ought to have had Hailey&#8217;s place.
Bucks never treated me right in that; he never
pushed me in the way he pushed other men that
were just as bad as I ever was. It discouraged me;
that&#8217;s the reason I went to pieces.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It could be no reason for treating me as you
treated me: for bringing drunken men and drunken
women into our house, and driving me out of it
unless I would be what you were and what they
were.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know I haven&#8217;t treated you right; I&#8217;ve
treated you shamefully. I will do anything on
earth you say to square it. I will! Recollect, I
had lived among men and in the same country
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
with women like that for years before I knew you.
I didn&#8217;t know how to treat you; I admit it. Give
me another chance, Marion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I gave you all that I had when I married you,
Murray. I haven&#8217;t anything more to give to any
man. You would be disappointed in me if I could
ever live with you again, and I could not do that
without living a lie every day.&#8221;</p>
<p>He bent forward, looking at the ground. He
talked of their first meeting in Wisconsin; of the
happiness of their little courtship; he brought up
California again, and the Northwest coast, where,
he told her, a great railroad was to be built and
he should find the chance he needed to make a
record for himself&ndash;&ndash;it had been promised him&ndash;&ndash;a
chance to be the man his abilities entitled him to
be in railroading. &#8220;And I&#8217;ve got a customer for
the ranch and the cows, Marion. I don&#8217;t care for
this business&ndash;&ndash;damn the cows! let somebody else
chase after &#8217;em through the sleet. I&#8217;ve done well;
I&#8217;ve made money&ndash;&ndash;a lot of money&ndash;&ndash;the last two
years in my cattle deals, and I&#8217;ve got it put away,
Marion; you need never lift your hand to work
in our house again. We can live in California,
and live well, under our own orange trees, whether
I work or not. All I want to know is, will you go
with me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No! I will not go with you, Murray.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span></div>
<p>He moved in his seat and threw his head up
appealingly. &#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will never be dishonest with you; I never
have been and I never will be. I have nothing in
my heart to give you, and I will not live upon your
money. I am earning my own living. I am as
content as I ever can be, and I shall stay where I
am and do what I am doing till I die, probably.
And this is why I came when you asked me to;
to tell you the exact truth. I am not a girl any
longer&ndash;&ndash;I never can be again. I am a woman.
What I was before I married you I never can be
again, and you have no right to ask me to be a
hypocrite and say I can love you&ndash;&ndash;for that is what
it all comes to&ndash;&ndash;when I have no such thing in my
heart or life for you. It is dead and gone, and I
cannot help it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That sounds pretty hard, Marion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is only the truth. It sounded fearfully
hard to me when you told me that woman was
your friend&ndash;&ndash;that you knew her before you knew
me and would know her after I was dead; that
she was as good as I, and that if I didn&#8217;t entertain
her you would. But it was the truth; you
told me the truth, and it was better that you told
it&ndash;&ndash;as it is better now that I tell it to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was drunk. I didn&#8217;t tell you the truth. A
man is a pretty tough animal sometimes, but you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
are a woman and a pure one, and I care more for
you than for all the other women in the world, and
it is not your nature to be unforgiving.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is to be honest.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked suddenly up at her and spoke
sharply: &#8220;Marion, I know why you won&#8217;t go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have honestly told you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; you have not honestly told me. The real
reason is Gordon Smith.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If he were I should not hesitate to tell you,
Murray, but he is not,&#8221; she said coldly.</p>
<p>Sinclair spoke harshly: &#8220;Do you think you can
fool me? Don&#8217;t you suppose I know he spends
his time loafing around your shop?&#8221;</p>
<p>Marion flushed indignantly. &#8220;It is not true!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you suppose I know he writes letters
back to Wisconsin to your folks?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What have I to do with that? Why shouldn&#8217;t
he write to my mother? Who has a better right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t drive me too far. By God! if I go
away alone I&#8217;ll never leave you here to run off with
Whispering Smith&ndash;&ndash;remember that!&#8221; She sat in
silence. His rage left her perfectly quiet, and her
unmoved expression shamed and in part silenced
him. &#8220;Don&#8217;t drive me too far,&#8221; he muttered
sullenly. &#8220;If you do you will be responsible,
Marion.&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not move her eyes from the blue hills
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
on the horizon. &#8220;I expect you to kill me sometime;
I feel sure you will. And that you may do.&#8221;
Then she bent her look on him. &#8220;You may do
it now if you want to.&#8221;</p>
<p>His face turned heavy with rage. &#8220;Marion,&#8221;
he cried, with an oath, &#8220;do you know how close
you are to death at this moment?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You may do it now.&#8221;</p>
<p>He clinched the bench-rail and rose slowly to
his feet. Marion sat motionless in the hickory
chair; the sun was shining in her face and her
hands were folded in her lap. Dicksie rocked on
the porch. In the shadow of the house the man
was mending the saddle.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h3>TOWER W</h3>
</div>
<p>At the end of a long and neglected hall on the
second floor of the old bank block in Hill
Street, Whispering Smith had a room in which he
made headquarters at Medicine Bend; it was in
effect Whispering Smith&#8217;s home. A man&#8217;s room is
usually a forlorn affair in spite of any effort to
make it home-like. If he neglects his room it looks
barren, and if he ornaments it it looks fussy. Boys
can do something with a den because they are not
yet men, and some tincture of woman&#8217;s nature still
clings to a boy. Girls are born to the deftness that
is to become all theirs in the touch of a woman&#8217;s
hand; but men, if they walk alone, pay the penalty
of loneliness.</p>
<p>Whispering Smith, being logical, made no effort
to decorate his domestic poverty. All his belongings
were of a simple sort and his room was as
bare as a Jesuit&#8217;s. Moreover, his affairs, being at
times highly particular, did not admit of the presence
of a janitor in his quarters, and he was of
necessity his own janitor. His iron bed was spread
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
with a pair of Pullman blankets, his toilet arrangements
included nothing more elaborate than a
shaving outfit, and the mirror above his washstand
was only large enough to make a hurried shave,
with much neck-stretching, possible. The table
was littered with letters, but it filled up one corner
of the room, and a rocking-chair and a trunk filled
up another. The floor was spread with a Navajo
blanket, and near the head of the bed stood an
old-fashioned wardrobe. This served not to ward
Whispering Smith&#8217;s robes, which hung for the most
part on his back, but to accommodate his rifles,
of which it contained an array that only a practised
man could understand. The wardrobe was
more, however, than an armory. Beside the guns
that stood racked in precision along the inner wall,
McCloud had once, to his surprise, seen a violin.
It appeared out of keeping in such an atmosphere
and rather the antithesis of force and violence than
a complement for it. And again, though the rifles
were disquietingly bright and effective-looking, the
violin was old and shabby, hanging obscurely in
its corner, as if, whatever it might have in common
with its master, it had nothing in common
with its surroundings.</p>
<p>The door of the room in the course of many
years had been mutilated with keyholes and re&euml;nforced
with locks until it appeared difficult to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
choose an opening that would really afford entrance;
but two men besides Whispering Smith
carried keys to the room&ndash;&ndash;Kennedy and George
McCloud. They had right of way into it at all
hours, and knew how to get in.</p>
<p>McCloud had left the bridge camp on the river
for Medicine Bend on the Saturday that Marion
Sinclair&ndash;&ndash;whose husband had finally told her he
would give her one more chance to think it over&ndash;&ndash;returned
with Dicksie safely from their trip to the
Frenchman ranch.</p>
<p>Whispering Smith, who had been with Bucks
and Morris Blood, got back to town the same day.
The president and general manager were at the
Wickiup during the afternoon, and left for the
East at nine o&#8217;clock in the evening, when their car
was attached to an east-bound passenger train.
McCloud took supper afterward with Whispering
Smith at a Front Street chop-house, and the two
men separated at eleven o&#8217;clock. It was three
hours later when McCloud tapped on the door
of Smith&#8217;s room, and in a moment opened it.
&#8220;Awake, Gordon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure: come in. What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The second section of the passenger train&ndash;&ndash;Number
Three, with the express cars&ndash;&ndash;was stopped
at Tower W to-night. Oliver Sollers was pulling;
he is badly shot up, and one of the messengers was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
shot all to pieces. They cracked the through safe,
emptied it, and made a clean get-away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tower W&ndash;&ndash;two hundred and seventy-six miles.
Have you ordered up an engine?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Kennedy?&#8221;</p>
<p>A second voice answered: &#8220;Right here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Strike a light, Farrell. What about the
horses?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re being loaded.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is the line clear?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rooney Lee is clearing it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Spike it, George, and leave every westbound
train in siding, with the engine cut loose and plenty
of steam, till we get by. It&#8217;s now or never this
time. Two hundred and seventy-six miles; they&#8217;re
giving us our money&#8217;s worth. Who&#8217;s going with
us, Farrell?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bob Scott, Reed Young, and Brill, if Reed can
get him at Sleepy Cat. Dancing is loading the
horses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want Ed Banks to lead a <i>posse</i> straight from
here for Williams Cache; Dancing can go with
him. And telephone Gene and Bob Johnson to sit
down in Canadian Pass till they grow to the rocks,
but not to let anybody through if they want to live
after I see them. They&#8217;ve got all the instructions;
all they need is the word. It&#8217;s a long chance,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
but I think these are our friends. You can head
Banks off by telephone somewhere if we change
our minds when we get a trail. Start Brill Young
and a good man from Sleepy Cat ahead of us,
George, if you can, in a baggage car with any
horses that they can get there. They can be at
Tower W by daybreak and perhaps pick up a trail
before we reach there, and we shall have fresh
horses for them. I&#8217;m ready, I guess; let&#8217;s go.
Slam the door, George!&#8221; In the hall Whispering
Smith threw a pocket-light on his watch. &#8220;I want
you to put us there by seven o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Charlie Sollers is going to pull you,&#8221; answered
McCloud. &#8220;Have you got everything? Then
we&#8217;re off.&#8221; The three men tiptoed down the dark
hall, down the stairs, and across the street on a
noiseless run for the railroad yard.</p>
<p>The air was chill and the sky clear, with a moon
more than half to the full. &#8220;Lord, what a night
to ride!&#8221; exclaimed Whispering Smith, looking
mournfully at the stars. &#8220;Well planned, well
planned, I must admit.&#8221;</p>
<p>The men hastened toward the yard, where lanterns
were moving about the car of the train-guards
near the Blue Front stables. The loading
board had been lowered, and the horses were
being carefully led into the car. From a switch
engine behind the car a shrill cloud of steam billowed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
into the air. Across the yard a great passenger
engine, its huge white side-rod rising and
falling slowly in the still light of the moon&ndash;&ndash;one
of the mountain racers, thick-necked like an athlete
and deep-chested&ndash;&ndash;was backing down for the
run with the single car almost across the west end
of the division. Trainmen were running to and
from the Wickiup platform. By the time the
horses were loaded the conductor had orders.
Until the last minute, Whispering Smith was in
consultation with McCloud, and giving Dancing
precise instructions for the <i>posse</i> into the Cache
country. They were still talking at the side door
of the car, McCloud and Dancing on the ground
and Whispering Smith squatting on his haunches
inside the moving car, when the engine signalled
and the special drew away from the chute, pounded
up the long run of the ladder switch, and moved
with gathering speed into the canyon. In the cab
Charlie Sollers, crushing in his hand the tissue that
had brought the news of his brother&#8217;s death, sat
at the throttle. He had no speed orders. They
had only told him he had a clear track.</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XXVII_PURSUIT' id='CHAPTER_XXVII_PURSUIT'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h3>PURSUIT</h3>
</div>
<p>Brill Young picked up a trail Sunday
morning at Tower W before the special
from Medicine Bend reached there. The wrecked
express car, which had been set out, had no story to
tell. &#8220;The only story,&#8221; said Whispering Smith, as
the men climbed into their saddles, &#8220;is in the one
from the hoofs, and the sooner we get after it the
better.&#8221;</p>
<p>The country around Tower W, which is itself
an operating point on the western end of the division,
a mere speck on the desert, lies high and
rolling. To the south, sixty miles away, rise the
Grosse Terre Mountains, and to the north and
west lie the solitudes of the Heart range, while in
the northeast are seen the three white Saddle peaks
of the Missions. The cool, bright sunshine of a
far and lonely horizon greets the traveller here,
and ten miles away from the railroad, in any direction,
a man on horseback and unacquainted with
the country would wish himself&ndash;&ndash;mountain men
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
will tell you&ndash;&ndash;in hell, because it would be easier to
ride out of.</p>
<p>To the railroad men the country offered no unusual
difficulties. The Youngs were as much at
home on a horse as on a hand car. Kennedy,
though a large and powerful man, was inured to
hard riding, and Bob Scott and Whispering Smith
in the saddle were merely a part&ndash;&ndash;though an important
part&ndash;&ndash;of their horses; without killing their
mounts, they could get out of them every mile in
their legs. The five men covered twenty miles on
a trail that read like print. One after another of
the railroad party commented on the carelessness
with which it had been left. But twenty miles south
of the railroad, in an open and comparatively easy
country, it was swallowed completely up in the
tracks of a hundred horses. The railroad men
circled far and wide, only to find the herd tracks
everywhere ahead of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a beautiful job,&#8221; murmured Whispering
Smith as the party rode together along the
edge of a creek-bottom. &#8220;Now who is their friend
down in this country? What man would get out
a bunch of horses like this and work them this
hard so early in the morning? Let&#8217;s hunt that
man up. I like to meet a man that is a friend in
need.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob Scott spoke: &#8220;I saw a man with some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
horses in a canyon across the creek a few minutes
ago, and I saw a ranch-house behind those buttes
when I rode around them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop! Here&#8217;s a man riding right into our
jaws,&#8221; muttered Kennedy. &#8220;Divide up among the
rocks.&#8221; A horseman from the south came galloping
up the creek, and Kennedy rode out with an
ivory smile to meet him. The two men parleyed
for a moment, disputed each other sharply, and
rode together back to the railroad party.</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t seen any men looking for horses this
morning, have you?&#8221; asked Whispering Smith,
eying the stranger, a squat, square-jawed fellow
with a cataract eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m looking for horses myself. I ain&#8217;t seen
anybody else. What are you looking for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this your bunch of horses that got loose
here?&#8221; asked Smith.</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought,&#8221; said Kennedy, smiling, &#8220;you said
a minute ago they were.&#8221;</p>
<p>The stranger fixed his cataract on him like a
flash-light. &#8220;I changed my mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whispering Smith&#8217;s brows rose protestingly, but
he spoke with perfect amiability as he raised his
finger to bring the good eye his way. &#8220;You ought
to change your hat when you change your mind.
I saw you driving a bunch of horses up that canyon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
a few minutes ago. Now, Rockstro, do you still
drag your left leg?&#8221;</p>
<p>The rancher looked steadily at his new inquisitor,
but blinked like a gopher at the sudden onslaught.
&#8220;Which of you fellows is Whispering
Smith?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;The man with the dough is Whispering Smith
every time,&#8221; was the answer from Smith himself.
&#8220;You have about seven years to serve, Rockstro,
haven&#8217;t you? Seven, I think. Now what have I
ever done to you that you should turn a trick like
this on me? I knew you were here, and you knew
I knew you were here, and I call this a pretty country;
a little smooth right around here, like the
people, but pretty. Have I ever bothered you?
Now tell me one thing&ndash;&ndash;what did you get for covering
this trail? I stand to give you two dollars
for every one you got last night for the job, if
you&#8217;ll put us right on the game. Which way did
they go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you talking about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get off your horse a minute,&#8221; suggested Whispering
Smith, dismounting, &#8220;and step over here
toward the creek.&#8221; The man, afraid to refuse and
unwilling to go, walked haltingly after Smith.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, Rockstro?&#8221; asked his tormentor.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you like this country? What do you want
to go back to the penitentiary for? Aren&#8217;t you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
happy here? Now tell me one thing&ndash;&ndash;will you
give up the trail?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know the trail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you; we shouldn&#8217;t follow it anyway.
Were you paid last night or this morning?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t seen a man hereabouts for a week.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you can&#8217;t tell me whether there were five
men or six?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got one eye as good as mine, and one
a whole lot better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So it was fixed up for cash a week ago?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything is cash in this country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Rockstro, I&#8217;m sorry, but we&#8217;ll have to
take you back with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rancher whipped out a revolver. Whispering
Smith caught his wrist. The struggle lasted
only an instant. Rockstro writhed, and the pistol
fell to the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, shall I break your arm?&#8221; asked Smith,
as the man cursed and resisted. &#8220;Or will you
behave? We are going right back and you&#8217;ll have
to come with us. We&#8217;ll send some one down to
round up your horses and sell them, and you can
serve out your time&ndash;&ndash;with allowances, of course,
for good conduct, which will cut it down. If I had
ever done you a mean turn I would not say a word.
If you could name a friend of yours I had ever
done a mean turn to I would not say a word.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
Can you name one? I guess not. I have left you
as free as the wind here, making only the rule I
make for everybody&ndash;&ndash;to let the railroad alone.
This is my thanks. Now, I&#8217;ll ask you just one
question. I haven&#8217;t killed you, as I had a perfect
right to when you pulled; I haven&#8217;t broken your
arm, as I would have done if there had been a
doctor within twenty-five miles; and I haven&#8217;t
started you for the pen&ndash;&ndash;not yet. Now I ask you
one fair question only: Did you need the money?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I did need it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whispering Smith dropped the man&#8217;s wrist.
&#8220;Then I don&#8217;t say a word. If you needed the
money, I&#8217;m not going to send you back&ndash;&ndash;not for
mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How can a man make a living in this country,&#8221;
asked the rancher, with a bitter oath, &#8220;unless
he picks up everything that&#8217;s going?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pick up your gun, man! I&#8217;m not saying anything,
am I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m damned if I can give a double-cross to
any man,&#8221; added Rockstro, stooping for his revolver.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think less of you, Rockstro, if you
did. You don&#8217;t need money anyway now, but
sometime you may need a friend. I&#8217;m going to
leave you here. You&#8217;ll hear no more of this, and
I&#8217;m going to ask you a question: Why did you go
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
against this when you knew you&#8217;d have to square
yourself with me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They told me you&#8217;d be taken care of before it
was pulled off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They lied to you, didn&#8217;t they? No matter,
you&#8217;ve got their stuff. Now I am going to ask you
one question that I don&#8217;t know the answer to; it&#8217;s
a fair question, too. Was Du Sang in the penitentiary
with you at Fort City? Answer fair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you. Behave yourself and keep your
mouth shut. I say nothing this time. Hereafter
leave railroad matters alone, and if the woman
should fall sick or you have to have a little money,
come and see me.&#8221; Smith led the way back to the
horses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here!&#8221; muttered Rockstro, following,
with his good eye glued on his companion. &#8220;I
pulled on you too quick, I guess&ndash;&ndash;quicker&#8217;n I&#8217;d
ought to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mention it. You didn&#8217;t pull quick
enough; it is humiliating to have a man that&#8217;s as
slow as you are pull on me. People that pull on
me usually pull and shoot at the same time. Two
distinct movements, Rockstro, should be avoided;
they are fatal to success. Come down to the Bend
sometime, and I&#8217;ll get you a decent gun and give
you a few lessons.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span></div>
<p>Whispering Smith drew his handkerchief as the
one-eyed man rode away and he rejoined his companions.
He was resigned, after a sickly fashion.
&#8220;I like to play blind-man&#8217;s-buff,&#8221; he said, wiping
his forehead, &#8220;but not so far from good water.
They have pulled us half-way to the Grosse Terre
Mountains on a beautiful trail, too beautiful to be
true, Farrell&ndash;&ndash;too beautiful to be true. They have
been having fun with us, and they&#8217;ve doubled back,
through the Topah Topahs toward the Mission
Mountains and Williams Cache&ndash;&ndash;that is my judgment.
And aren&#8217;t we five able-bodied jays, gentlemen?
Five strong-arm suckers? It is an inelegant
word; it is an inelegant feeling. No matter,
we know a few things. There are five good men
and a led horse; we can get out of here by Goose
River, find out when we cross the railroad how
much they got, and pick them up somewhere
around the Saddle peaks, <i>if</i> they&#8217;ve gone north.
That&#8217;s only a guess, and every man&#8217;s guess is good
now. What do you think, all of you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s the crowd we think it is, would they go
straight home? That doesn&#8217;t look reasonable, does
it?&#8221; asked Brill Young.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they could put one day between them and
pursuit, wouldn&#8217;t they be safer at home than anywhere
else? And haven&#8217;t they laid out one day&#8217;s
work for us, good and plenty? Farrell, remember
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
one thing: there is sometimes a disadvantage in
knowing too much about the men you are after.
We&#8217;ll try Goose River.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was noon when they struck the railroad.
They halted long enough to stop a freight train,
send some telegrams, and ask for news. They got
orders from Rooney Lee, had an empty box car
set behind the engine for a special, and, loading
their horses at the chute, made a helter-skelter run
for Sleepy Cat. At three o&#8217;clock they struck north
for the Mission Mountains.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<h3>THE SUNDAY MURDER</h3>
</div>
<p>Banks&#8217;s <i>posse</i>, leaving Medicine Bend before
daybreak, headed northwest. Their instructions
were explicit: to scatter after crossing the
Frenchman, watch the trails from the Goose River
country and through the Mission Mountains, and
intercept everybody riding north until the <i>posse</i>
from Sleepy Cat or Whispering Smith should
communicate with them from the southwest. Nine
men rode in the party that crossed the Crawling
Stone Sunday morning at sunrise with Ed
Banks.</p>
<p>After leaving the river the three white-capped
Saddles of the Mission range afford a landmark
for more than a hundred miles, and toward these
the party pressed steadily all day. The southern
pass of the Missions opens on the north slope of
the range into a pretty valley known as Mission
Springs Valley, and the springs are the head-waters
of Deep Creek. The <i>posse</i> did not quite obey
the instructions, and following a natural instinct of
safety five of them, after Banks and his three deputies
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
had scattered, bunched again, and at dark
crossed Deep Creek at some distance below the
springs. It was afterward known that these five
men had been seen entering the valley from the
east at sundown just as four of the men they
wanted rode down South Mission Pass toward the
springs. That they knew they would soon be cut
off, or must cut their way through the line
which Ed Banks, ahead of them, was posting at
every gateway to Williams Cache, was probably
clear to them. Four men rode that evening from
Tower W through the south pass; the fifth man
had already left the party. The four men were
headed for Williams Cache and had reason to believe,
until they sighted Banks&#8217;s men, that their
path was open.</p>
<p>They halted to take counsel on the suspicious-looking
<i>posse</i> far below them, and while their cruelly
exhausted horses rested, Du Sang, always in
Sinclair&#8217;s absence the brains of the gang, planned
the escape over Deep Creek at Baggs&#8217;s crossing.
At dusk they divided: two men lurking in the
brush along the creek rode as close as they could,
unobserved, toward the crossing, while Du Sang
and the cowboy Karg, known as Flat Nose, rode
down to Baggs&#8217;s ranch at the foot of the pass.</p>
<p>At that point Dan Baggs, an old locomotive
engineer, had taken a homestead, got together a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
little bunch of cattle, and was living alone with his
son, a boy of ten years. It was a hard country and
too close to Williams Cache for comfort, but Dan
got on with everybody because the toughest man
in the Cache country could get a meal, a feed for
his horse, and a place to sleep at Baggs&#8217;s, without
charge, when he needed it.</p>
<p>Ed Banks, by hard riding, got to the crossing at
five o&#8217;clock, and told Baggs of the hold-up and the
shooting of Oliver Sollers. The news stirred the
old engineman, and his excitement threw him off
his guard. Banks rode straight on for the middle
pass, leaving word that two of his men would be
along within half an hour to watch the pass and
the ranch crossing, and asking Baggs to put up
some kind of a fight for the crossing until more of
the <i>posse</i> came up&ndash;&ndash;at the least, to make sure that
nobody got any fresh horses.</p>
<p>The boy was cooking supper in the kitchen, and
Baggs had done his milking and gone back to the
corral, when two men rode around the corner of
the barn and asked if they could get something to
eat. Poor Baggs sold his life in six words: &#8220;Why,
yes; be you Banks&#8217;s men?&#8221;</p>
<p>Du Sang answered: &#8220;No; we&#8217;re from Sheriff
Coon&#8217;s office at Oroville, looking up a bunch of
Duck Bar steers that&#8217;s been run somewhere up
Deep Creek. Can we stay here all night?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span></div>
<p>They dismounted and disarmed Baggs&#8217;s suspicions,
though the condition of their horses might
have warned him had he had his senses. The unfortunate
man had probably fixed it in his mind
that a ride from Tower W to Deep Creek in sixteen
hours was a physical impossibility.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stay here? Sure! I want you to stay,&#8221; said
Baggs bluffly. &#8220;Looks to me like I seen you
down at Crawling Stone, ain&#8217;t I?&#8221; he asked of
Karg.</p>
<p>Karg was lighting a cigarette. &#8220;I used to mark
at the Dunning ranch,&#8221; he answered, throwing
away his match.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s hit. Good! The boy&#8217;s cooking supper.
Step up to the kitchen and tell him to cut ham
for four more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Four?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two of Ed Banks&#8217;s men will be here by six
o&#8217;clock. Heard about the hold-up? They stopped
Number Three at Tower W last night and shot
Ollie Sollers, as white a boy as ever pulled a throttle.
Boys, a man that&#8217;ll kill a locomotive engineer
is worse&#8217;n an Indian; I&#8217;d help skin him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The hell you would!&#8221; cried Du Sang.
&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t you want to start in on me? I
killed Sollers. Look at me; ain&#8217;t I handsome?
What you going to do about it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Before Baggs could think Du Sang was shooting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
him down. It was wanton. Du Sang stood in no
need of the butchery; the escape could have been
made without it. His victim had pulled an engine
throttle too long to show the white feather, but
he was dying by the time he had dragged a revolver
from his pocket. Du Sang did the killing
alone. At least, Flat Nose, who alone saw all of
the murder, afterward maintained that he did not
draw because he had no occasion to, and that
Baggs was dead before he, Karg, had finished his
cigarette. With his right arm broken and two bullets
through his chest, Baggs fell on his face.
That, however, did not check his murderer. Rising
to his knees, Baggs begged for his life. &#8220;For
God&#8217;s sake! I&#8217;m helpless, gentlemen! I&#8217;m helpless.
Don&#8217;t kill me like a dog!&#8221; But Du Sang,
emptying his pistol, threw his rifle to his shoulder
and sent bullet after bullet crashing through the
shapeless form writhing and twitching before him
until he had beaten it in the dust soft and flat and
still.</p>
<p>Banks&#8217;s men came up within an hour to find the
ranch-house deserted. They saw a lantern in the
yard below, and near the corral gate they found
the little boy in the darkness, screaming beside his
father&#8217;s body. The sheriff&#8217;s men carried the old
engineman to the house; others of the <i>posse</i> crossed
the creek during the evening, and at eleven o&#8217;clock
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
Whispering Smith rode down from the south pass
to find that four of the men they were after had
taken fresh horses, after killing Baggs, and passed
safely through the cordon Banks had drawn around
the pass and along Deep Creek. Bill Dancing, who
had ridden with Banks&#8217;s men, was at the house
when Whispering Smith arrived. He found some
supper in the kitchen, and the tired man and the
giant ate together.</p>
<p>Whispering Smith was too experienced a campaigner
to complain. His party had struck a trail
fifty miles north of Sleepy Cat and followed it to
the Missions. He knew now who he was after,
and knew that they were bottled up in the Cache
for the night. The sheriff&#8217;s men were sleeping
on the floor of the living-room when Smith came
in from the kitchen. He sat down before the fire.
At intervals sobs came from the bedroom where
the body lay, and after listening a moment, Whispering
Smith got stiffly up, and, tiptoeing to still
the jingle of his spurs, took the candle from the
table, pushed aside the curtain, and entered the
bedroom.</p>
<p>The little boy was lying on his face, with his
arm around his father&#8217;s neck, talking to him.
Whispering Smith bent a moment over the bed,
and, setting the candle on the table, put his hand
on the boy&#8217;s shoulder. He disengaged the hand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
from the cold neck, and sitting down took it in
his own. Talking low to the little fellow, he got
his attention after much patient effort and got him
to speak. He made him, though struggling with
terror, to understand that he had come to be his
friend, and after the child had sobbed his grief
into a strange heart he ceased to tremble, and told
his name and his story, and described the two
horsemen and the horses they had left. Smith
listened quietly. &#8220;Have you had any supper,
Dannie? No? You must have something to eat.
Can&#8217;t you eat anything? But there is a nice pan
of fresh milk in the kitchen.&#8221;</p>
<p>A burst of tears interrupted him. &#8220;Daddie just
brought in the milk, and I was frying the ham, and
I heard them shooting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;See how he took care of you till the last minute,
and left something for you after he was gone.
Suppose he could speak now, don&#8217;t you think he
would want you to do as I say? I am your next
friend now, for you are going to be a railroad man
and have a big engine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dannie looked up. &#8220;Dad wasn&#8217;t afraid of
those men.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t he, Dannie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He said we would be all right and not to be
afraid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span></div>
<p>&#8220;He said Whispering Smith was coming.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My poor boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is coming, don&#8217;t be afraid. Do you know
Whispering Smith? He is coming. The men
to-night all said he was coming.&#8221;</p>
<p>The little fellow for a long time could not be
coaxed away from his father, but his companion
at length got him to the kitchen. When they came
back to the bedroom the strange man was talking
to him once more about his father. &#8220;We
must try to think how he would like things done
now, mustn&#8217;t we? All of us felt so bad when we
rode in and had so much to do we couldn&#8217;t attend
to taking care of your father. Did you know there
are two men out at the crossing now, guarding
it with rifles? But if you and I keep real quiet
we can do something for him while the men are
asleep; they have to ride all day to-morrow. We
must wash his face and hands, don&#8217;t you think so?
And brush his hair and his beard. If you could
just find the basin and some water and a towel&ndash;&ndash;you
couldn&#8217;t find a brush, could you? Could you,
honestly? Well! I call that a good boy&ndash;&ndash;we shall
have to have you on the railroad, sure. We must
try to find some fresh clothes&ndash;&ndash;these are cut and
stained; then I will change his clothes, and we
shall all feel better. Don&#8217;t disturb the men; they
are tired.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span></div>
<p>They worked together by the candle-light.
When they had done, the boy had a violent crying
spell, but Whispering Smith got him to lie down
beside him on a blanket spread on the floor, where
Smith got his back against the sod wall and took
the boy&#8217;s head in his arm. He waited patiently
for the boy to go to sleep, but Dan was afraid the
murderers would come back. Once he lifted his
head in a confidence. &#8220;Did you know my daddy
used to run an engine?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I did not; but in the morning you must
tell me all about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whenever there was a noise in the next room
the child roused. After some time a new voice was
heard; Kennedy had come and was asking questions.
&#8220;Wake up here, somebody! Where is
Whispering Smith?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dancing answered: &#8220;He&#8217;s right there in the
bedroom, Farrell, staying with the boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was some stirring. Kennedy talked a
little and at length stretched himself on the floor.
When all was still again, Dannie&#8217;s hand crept
slowly from the breast of his companion up to his
chin, and the little hand, feeling softly every feature,
stole over the strange face.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, Dannie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you Whispering Smith?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Dannie. Shut your eyes.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span></div>
<p>At three o&#8217;clock, when Kennedy lighted a candle
and looked in, Smith was sitting with his back
against the wall. The boy lay on his arm. Both
were fast asleep. On the bed the dead man lay
with a handkerchief over his face.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<h3>WILLIAMS CACHE</h3>
</div>
<p>Ed Banks had been recalled before daybreak
from the middle pass. Two of the men
wanted were now known to have crossed the creek,
which meant they must work out of the country
through Williams Cache.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you will take your best two men, Ed,&#8221; said
Whispering Smith, sitting down with Banks at
breakfast, &#8220;and strike straight for Canadian Pass
to help Gene and Bob Johnson, I&#8217;ll undertake to
ride in and talk to Rebstock while Kennedy and
Bob Scott watch Deep Creek. The boy gives a
good description, and the two men that did the job
here are Du Sang and Flat Nose. Did I tell you
how we picked up the trail yesterday? Magpies.
They shot a scrub horse that gave out on them and
skinned the brand. It hastened the banquet, but
we got there before the birds were all seated.
Great luck, wasn&#8217;t it? And it gave us a beautiful
trail. One of the party crossed the Goose River
at American Fork, and Brill Young and Reed followed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
him. Four came through the Mission
Mountains; that is a cinch and they are in the
Cache&ndash;&ndash;and if they get out it is our fault personally,
Ed, and not the Lord&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>Williams Cache lies in the form of a great horn,
with a narrow entrance at the lower end known as
the Door, and a rock fissure at the upper end leading
into Canadian Pass; but this fissure is so narrow
that a man with a rifle could withstand a regiment.
For a hundred miles east and west rise the granite
walls of the Mission range, broken nowhere save
by the formation known as the Cache. Even this
does not penetrate the range; it is a pocket, and
runs not over half-way into it and out again. But
no man really knows the Cache; the most that may
be said is that the main valley is known, and it is
known as the roughest mountain fissure between
the Spanish Sinks and the Mantrap country. Williams
Cache lies between walls two thousand feet
high, and within it is a small labyrinth of canyons.
A generation ago, when Medicine Bend for one
winter was the terminus of the overland railroad,
vigilantes mercilessly cleaned out the town, and
the few outlaws that escaped the shotgun and the
noose at Medicine Bend found refuge in a far-away
and unknown mountain gorge once named
by French trappers the Cache. Years after these
outcasts had come to infest it came one desperado
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
more ferocious than all that had gone before. He
made a frontier retreat of the Cache, and left to
it the legacy of his evil name, Williams. Since his
day it has served, as it served before, for the haunt
of outlawed men. No honest man lives in Williams
Cache, and few men of any sort live there
long, since their lives are lives of violence; neither
the law nor a woman crosses Deep Creek. But
from the day of Williams to this day the Cache
has had its ruler, and when Whispering Smith
rode with a little party through the Door into the
Cache the morning after the murder in Mission
Valley he sent an envoy to Rebstock, whose success
as a cattle-thief had brought its inevitable penalty.
It had made Rebstock a man of consequence
and of property and a man subject to the anxieties
and annoyances of such responsibility.</p>
<p>Sitting once in the Three Horses at Medicine
Bend, Rebstock had talked with Whispering Smith.
&#8220;I used to have a good time,&#8221; he growled.
&#8220;When I was rustling a little bunch of steers, just
a small bunch all by myself, and hadn&#8217;t a cent in
the world, no place to sleep and nothing to eat,
I had a good time. Now I have to keep my
money in the bank; that ain&#8217;t pleasant&ndash;&ndash;you know
that. Every man that brings a bunch of cattle
across Deep Creek has stole &#8217;em, and expects me
to buy &#8217;em or lend him money. I&#8217;m busy with inspecters
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
all the time, deviling with brands, standing
off the Stock Association and all kinds of
trouble. I&#8217;ve got too many cows, too much money.
I&#8217;m afraid somebody will shoot me if I go to sleep,
or poison me if I take a drink. Whispering Smith,
I&#8217;d like to give you a half-interest in my business.
That&#8217;s on the square. You&#8217;re a young man, and
handy; it wouldn&#8217;t cost you a cent, and you can
have half of the whole shooting-match if you&#8217;ll
cross Deep Creek and help me run the gang.&#8221;
Such was Rebstock free from anxiety and in a confidential
moment. Under pressure he was, like
all men, different.</p>
<p>Whispering Smith had acquaintance even in the
Cache, and after a little careful reconnoitring he
found a crippled-up thief, driving a milch cow
down the Cache, who was willing to take a message
to the boss.</p>
<p>Whispering Smith gave his instructions explicitly,
facing the messenger, as the two sat in their
saddles, with an importunate eye. &#8220;Say to Rebstock
exactly these words,&#8221; he insisted. &#8220;This is
from Whispering Smith: I want Du Sang. He
killed a friend of mine last night at Mission
Springs. I happened to be near there and know
he rode in last night. He can&#8217;t get out; the Canadian
is plugged. I won&#8217;t stand for the killing,
and it is Du Sang or a clean-up in the Cache all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
around, and then I&#8217;ll get Du Sang anyway. Regards.&#8221;</p>
<p>Riding circumspectly in and about the entrance
to the Cache, the party waited an hour for an answer.
When the answer came, it was unsatisfactory.
Rebstock declined to appear upon so trivial
a matter, and Whispering Smith refused to specify
a further grievance. More parley and stronger
messages were necessary to stir the Deep Creek
monarch, but at last he sent word asking Whispering
Smith to come to his cabin accompanied only
by Kennedy.</p>
<p>The two railroad men rode up the canyon together.
&#8220;And now I will show you a lean and
hungry thief grown monstrous and miserly, Farrell,&#8221;
said Whispering Smith.</p>
<p>At the head of a short pocket between two sheer
granite walls they saw Rebstock&#8217;s weather-beaten
cabin, and he stood in front of it smoking. He
looked moodily at his visitors out of eyes buried
between rolls of fat. Whispering Smith was a
little harsh as the two shook hands, but he dismounted
and followed Rebstock into the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you so high and mighty about?&#8221;
he demanded, throwing his hat on the table near
which Rebstock had seated himself. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t
you come out when I send a man to you, or
send word what you will do? What have you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
got to kick about? Haven&#8217;t you been treated
right?&#8221;</p>
<p>Being in no position to complain, but shrewdly
aware that much unpleasantness was in the wind,
Rebstock beat about the bush. He had had
rheumatism; he couldn&#8217;t ride; he had been in bed
three weeks and hadn&#8217;t seen Du Sang for three
months. &#8220;You ain&#8217;t chasing up here after Du
Sang because he killed a man at Mission Springs.
I know better than that. That ain&#8217;t the first man
he&#8217;s killed, and it ain&#8217;t a&#8217; goin&#8217; to be the last.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whispering Smith lifted his finger and for the
first time smiled. &#8220;Now there you err, Rebstock&ndash;&ndash;it
is &#8217;a goin&#8217; to be&#8217; the last. So you think I&#8217;m
after you, do you? Well, if I were, what are you
going to do about it? Rebstock, do you think, if
I wanted <i>you</i>, I would send a message for you to
come out and meet me? Not on your life! When
I want you I&#8217;ll come to your shack and drag you
out by the hair of the head. Sit down!&#8221; roared
Whispering Smith.</p>
<p>Rebstock, who weighed at least two hundred
and seventy-five pounds, had lifted himself up to
glare and swear freely. Now he dropped angrily
back into his chair. &#8220;Well, who do you want?&#8221;
he bellowed in kind.</p>
<p>A smile softened the asperity of the railroad
man&#8217;s face. &#8220;That&#8217;s a fair question and I give
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
you a straight answer. I&#8217;m not bluffing: I want
Du Sang.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rebstock squirmed. He swore with shortened
breath that he knew nothing about Du Sang; that
Du Sang had stolen his cattle; that hanging was
too good for him; that he would join any <i>posse</i> in
searching for him; and that he had not seen him
for three months.</p>
<p>&#8220;Likely enough,&#8221; assented Whispering Smith,
&#8220;but this is wasting time. He rode in here last
night after killing old Dan Baggs. Your estimable
nephew Barney is with him, and Karg is
with him, and I want them; but, in especial and
particular, I want Du Sang.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rebstock denied, protested, wheezed, and
stormed, but Whispering Smith was immovable.
He would not stir from the Cache upon any promises.
Rebstock offered to surrender any one else
in the Cache&ndash;&ndash;hinted strongly at two different men
for whom handsome rewards were out; but every
compromise suggested was met with the same
good-natured words: &#8220;I want Du Sang.&#8221;</p>
<p>At last the smile changed on Whispering Smith&#8217;s
face. It lighted his eyes still, but with a different
expression. &#8220;See here, Rebstock, you and I have
always got along, haven&#8217;t we? I&#8217;ve no desire to
crowd any man to the wall that is a man. Now
I am going to tell you the simple truth. Du Sang
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
has got you scared to death. That man is a faker,
Rebstock. Because he kills men right and left
without any provocation, you think he is dangerous.
He isn&#8217;t; there are a dozen men in the Cache
just as good with a gun as Du Sang is. Don&#8217;t
shake your head. I know what I&#8217;m talking about.
He is a jay with a gun, and you may tell him I
said so; do you hear? Tell him to come out if he
wants me to demonstrate it. He has got everybody,
including you, scared to death. Now, I say,
don&#8217;t be silly. I want Du Sang.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rebstock rose to his feet solemnly and pointed
his finger at Whispering Smith. &#8220;Whispering
Smith, you know me&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you for a fat rascal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right. You know me, and, just as
you say, we always get along because we both got
sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re hiding yours to-day, Rebstock.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No matter; I&#8217;ll tell you what I&#8217;ll do. I&#8217;ll give
you all the horseflesh you can kill and all the men
you can hire to go after him, and I&#8217;ll bury your
dead myself. You think he can&#8217;t shoot? I give
you a tip on the square.&#8221; Whispering Smith
snorted. &#8220;He&#8217;ll shoot the four buttons off your
coat in four shots.&#8221; Smith kicked Rebstock&#8217;s dog
contemptuously. &#8220;And do it while you are falling
down. I&#8217;ve seen him do it,&#8221; persisted Rebstock,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
moist with perspiration. &#8220;I&#8217;m not looking
for a chance to go against a sure thing; I wash my
hands of the job.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whispering Smith rose. &#8220;It was no trick to
see he had you scared to death. You are losing
your wits, old man. The albino is a faker, and I
tell you I am going to run him out of the country.&#8221;
Whispering Smith reached for his hat.
&#8220;Our treaty ends right here. You promised to
harbor no man in your sink that ever went against
our road. You know as well as I do that this
man, with four others, held up our train night before
last at Tower W, shot our engineman to
death for mere delight, killed a messenger, took
sixty-five thousand dollars out of the through safe,
and made his good get-away. Now, don&#8217;t lie; you
know every word of it, and you thought you could
pull it out of me by a bluff. I track him to your
door. He is inside the Cache this minute. You
know every curve and canyon and pocket and washout
in it, and every cut-throat and jail-bird in it,
and they pay you blood-money and hush-money
every month; and when I ask you not to give up
a dozen men the company is entitled to, but merely
to send this pink-eyed lobster out with his guns to
talk with me, you wash your hands of the job, do
you? Now listen. If you don&#8217;t send Du Sang into
the open before noon to-morrow, I&#8217;ll run every
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
living steer and every living man out of Williams
Cache before I cross the Crawling Stone again, so
help me God! And I&#8217;ll send for cowboys within
thirty minutes to begin the job. I&#8217;ll scrape your
Deep Creek canyons till the rattlesnakes squeal.
I&#8217;ll make Williams Cache so wild that a timber-wolf
can&#8217;t follow his own trail through it. You&#8217;ll
break with me, will you, Rebstock? Then wind
up your bank account; before I finish with you
I&#8217;ll put you in stripes and feed buzzards off your
table.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rebstock&#8217;s face was apoplectic. He choked with
a torrent of oaths. Whispering Smith, paying
no attention, walked out to where Kennedy was
waiting. He swung into the saddle, ignoring
Rebstock&#8217;s abjurations, and with Kennedy rode
away.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is hard to do anything with a man that is
scared to death,&#8221; said Smith to his companion.
&#8220;Then, too, Rebstock&#8217;s nephew is probably in
this. In any case, when Du Sang has got Rebstock
scared, he is a dangerous man to be abroad.
We have got to smoke him out, Farrell. Lance
Dunning insisted the other day he wanted to do
me a favor. I&#8217;ll see if he&#8217;ll lend me Stormy Gorman
and some of his cowpunchers for a round-up.
We&#8217;ve got to smoke Du Sang out. A round-up is
the thing. But, by Heaven, if that round-up is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
actually pulled off it will be a classic when you and
I are gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thirty minutes afterward, messengers had taken
the Frenchman trail for Lance Dunning&#8217;s cowboys.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
<h3>THE FIGHT IN THE CACHE</h3>
</div>
<p>A clear night and a good moon made a
long ride possible, and the Crawling Stone
contingent, headed by Stormy Gorman, began coming
into the railroad camp by three o&#8217;clock the
next morning. With them rode the two Youngs,
who had lost the trail they followed across Goose
River and joined the cowboys on the road to the
north.</p>
<p>The party divided under Kennedy and Smith,
who rode through the Door into the Cache just
before daybreak.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what I am steering you against
this morning, Farrell,&#8221; said Whispering Smith.
&#8220;Certainly I should hate to run you into Du Sang,
but we can&#8217;t tell where we shall strike him. If
we have laid out the work right I ought to see
him as soon as anybody does. Accidents do happen,
but remember he will never be any more dangerous
than he is at the first moment. Get him
to talk. He gets nervous if he can&#8217;t shoot right
away. When you pull, get a bullet into his stomach
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
at the start, if you possibly can, to spoil his
aim. We mustn&#8217;t make the mistake of underestimating
him. Rebstock is right: he is a fright
with a revolver, and Sinclair and Seagrue are the
only men in the mountains that can handle a rifle
with him. Now we split here; and good luck!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want to take Brill Young with
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You take both the Youngs, Farrell. We shall
be among rocks, and if he tries to rush us there
is cover.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stormy Gorman with four Crawling Stone cowboys
followed Whispering Smith. Every rider on
the range had a grievance against Williams Cache,
and any of them would have been glad to undertake
reprisals against the rustlers under the wing of
Whispering Smith.</p>
<p>Just how in the mountains&ndash;&ndash;without telegraph,
newspapers, and all ordinary means of publicity&ndash;&ndash;news
travels so fast may not certainly be said.
The scattered lines of telephone wires help, but
news outstrips the wires. Moreover, there are no
telephones in the Mission Mountains. But on
the morning that the round-up party rode into the
Cache it was known in the streets of Medicine
Bend that the Tower W men had been tracked
into the north country; that some, if not all, of
them were in Williams Cache; that an ultimatum
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
had been given, and that Whispering Smith and
Kennedy had already ridden in with their men to
make it good.</p>
<p>Whispering Smith, with the cowboys, took the
rough country to the left, and Kennedy and his
party took the south prong of the Cache Creek.
The instructions were to make a clean sweep as
the line advanced. Behind the centre rode three
men to take stock driven in from the wings. Word
that was brief but reasonable had been sent everywhere
ahead. Every man, it was promised, that
could prove property should have a chance to do
so at the Door that day and the next; but any
brands that showed stolen cattle, or that had been
skinned or tampered with in any way, were to be
turned over to the Stock Association for the benefit
of owners.</p>
<p>The very first pocket raided started a row and
uncovered eighty head of five-year-old steers bearing
a mutilated Duck Bar brand. It was like poking
at rattlesnakes to undertake to clean out the
grassy retreats of the Cache, but the work was
pushed on in spite of protests, threats, and resistance.
Every man that rode out openly to make a
protest was referred calmly to Rebstock, and before
very long Rebstock&#8217;s cabin had more men
around it than had been seen together in the Cache
for years. The impression that the whole jig was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
up, and that the refugees had been sold out by their
own boss, was one that no railroad man undertook
to discourage. The cowboys insisted on the cattle,
with the assurance that Rebstock could explain
everything. By noon the Cache was in an uproar.
The cowboys were riding carefully, and their
guards, rifles in hand, were watching the corners.
Ahead of the slowly moving line with the growing
bunch of cattle behind it, flourished as it were
rather conspicuously, fugitive riders dashed back
and forth with curses and yells across the narrow
valley. If it had been Whispering Smith&#8217;s intention
to raise a large-sized row it was apparent
that he had been successful. Rebstock, driven to
desperation, held council after council to determine
what to do. Sorties were discussed, ambushes considered,
and a pitched battle was planned. But,
while ideas were plentiful, no one aspired to lead
an attack on Whispering Smith.</p>
<p>Moreover, Williams Cache, it was conceded,
would in the end be worsted if the company and
the cowmen together seriously undertook with men
and unlimited money to clean it out. Whispering
Smith&#8217;s party had no explanation to offer for the
round-up, but when Rebstock made it known that
the fight was over sending out Du Sang, the rage
of the rustlers turned on Du Sang. Again, however,
no man wanted to take up personally with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
Du Sang the question of the reasonableness of
Whispering Smith&#8217;s demand. Instead of doing
so, they fell on Rebstock and demanded that
if he were boss he make good and send Du Sang
out.</p>
<p>Of all this commotion the railroad men saw only
the outward indications. As the excitement grew
on both sides there was perhaps a little more of
display in the way the cattle were run in, especially
when some long-lost bunch was brought to light
and welcomed with yells from the centre. A steer
was killed at noon, everybody fed, and the line
moved forward. The wind, which had slept in the
sunshine of the morning, rose in the afternoon, and
the dust whirled in little clouds where men or
animals moved. From the centre two men had
gone back with the cattle gathered up to that time,
and Bill Dancing, with Smith, Stormy Gorman,
and two of the cowboys, were heading a draw to
cross to the north side of the Cache, when three
men rode out into the road five hundred yards
ahead, and halted.</p>
<p>Whispering Smith spoke: &#8220;There come our
men; stop here. This ground in front of us looks
good to me; they may have chosen something over
there that suits them better. Feel your guns and
we&#8217;ll start forward slowly; don&#8217;t take your eyes
off the bunch, whatever you do. Bill, you go back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
and help the men with the cattle; there will be
four of us against three then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not for mine!&#8221; said Bill Dancing bluntly.
&#8220;You may need help from an old fool yet. I&#8217;ll
see you through this and look after the cattle
afterward.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, Stormy, one or two of you go back,&#8221;
urged Whispering Smith, speaking to the cowboy
foreman without turning his eyes. &#8220;There&#8217;s no
need of five of us in this.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Stormy swore violently. &#8220;You go back
yourself,&#8221; exclaimed Stormy, when he could control
his feelings. &#8220;We&#8217;ll bring them fellows in
for you in ten minutes with their hands in
the air.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you would; I know it. But I&#8217;m paid
for this sort of thing and you are not, and I advise
no man to take unnecessary chances. If you
all want to stay, why, stay; but don&#8217;t ride ahead
of the line, and let me do all the talking. See that
your guns are loose&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;ll never have but one
chance to pull, and don&#8217;t pull till you&#8217;re ready.
The albino is riding in the middle now, isn&#8217;t he?
And a little back, playing for a quick drop. Watch
him. Who is that on the right? Can it be
George Seagrue? Well, this is a bunch. And I
guess Karg is with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Holding their horses to a slow walk, the two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
parties gingerly approached each other. When
the Cache riders halted the railroad riders halted;
and when the three rode the five rode: but the
three rode with absolute alignment and acted as
one, while Whispering Smith had trouble in holding
his men back until the two lines were fifty feet
apart.</p>
<p>By this time the youngest of the cowboys had
steadied and was thinking hard. Whispering
Smith halted. In perfect order and sitting their
horses as if they were riding parade, the horses
ambling at a snail&#8217;s pace, the Cache riders advanced
in the sunshine like one man. When Du
Sang and his companions reined up, less than
twelve feet separated the two lines.</p>
<p>In his tan shirt, Du Sang, with his yellow hair,
his white eyelashes, and his narrow face, was the
least impressive of the three men. The Norwegian,
Seagrue, rode on the right, his florid blood showing
under the tan on his neck and arms. He spoke
to the cowboys from the ranch, and on the left the
young fellow Karg, with the broken nose, black-eyed
and alert, looked the men over in front of
him and nodded to Dancing. Du Sang and his
companions wore short-armed shirts; rifles were
slung at their pommels, and revolvers stuck in their
hip-scabbards. Whispering Smith, in his dusty
suit of khaki, was the only man in either line who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
showed no revolver, but a hammerless or muley
Savage rifle hung beside his pommel.</p>
<p>Du Sang, blinking, spoke first: &#8220;Which of you
fellows is heading this round-up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am heading the round-up,&#8221; said Whispering
Smith. &#8220;Why? Have we got some of your
cattle?&#8221;</p>
<p>The two men spoke as quietly as school-teachers.
Whispering Smith&#8217;s expression in no way
changed, except that as he spoke he lifted his eyebrows
a little more than usual.</p>
<p>Du Sang looked at him closely as he went on:
&#8220;What kind of a way is this to treat anybody?
To ride into a valley like this and drive a man&#8217;s
cows away from his door without notice or papers?
Is your name Smith?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My name is Smith; yours is Du Sang. Yes,
I&#8217;ll tell you, Du Sang. I carry an inspector&#8217;s card
from the Mountain Stock Association&ndash;&ndash;do you
want to see it? When we get these cattle to the
Door, any man in the Cache may come forward
and prove his property. I shall leave instructions
to that effect when we go, for I want you to go to
Medicine Bend with me, Du Sang, as soon as convenient,
and the men that are with me will finish
the round-up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want me for? There&#8217;s no papers
out against me, is there?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span></div>
<p>&#8220;No, but I&#8217;m an officer, Du Sang. I&#8217;ll see to
the papers; I want you for murder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So they tell me. Well, you&#8217;re after the wrong
man. But I&#8217;ll go with you; I don&#8217;t care about
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither do I, Du Sang; and as you have some
friends along, I won&#8217;t break up the party. They
may come, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For stopping a train at Tower W Saturday
night.&#8221;</p>
<p>The three men looked at one another and
laughed.</p>
<p>Du Sang with an oath spoke again: &#8220;The men
you want are in Canada by this time. I can&#8217;t
speak for my friends; I don&#8217;t know whether they
want to go or not. As far as I am concerned, I
haven&#8217;t killed anybody that I know of. I suppose
you&#8217;ll pay my expenses back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes, Du Sang, if you were coming back
I would pay your expenses; but you are not coming
back. You are riding down Williams Cache for
the last time; you&#8217;ve ridden down it too many
times already. This round-up is especially for
you. Don&#8217;t deceive yourself; when you ride with
me this time out of the Cache, you won&#8217;t come
back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Du Sang laughed, but his blinking eyes were as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
steady as a cat&#8217;s. It did not escape Whispering
Smith&#8217;s notice that the mettlesome horses ridden
by the outlaws were continually working around
to the right of his party. He spoke amiably to
Karg: &#8220;If you can&#8217;t manage that horse, Karg, I
can. Play fair. It looks to me as if you and Du
Sang were getting ready to run for it, and leave
George Seagrue to shoot his way through alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Du Sang, with some annoyance, intervened:
&#8220;That&#8217;s all right; I&#8217;ll go with you. I&#8217;d rather
see your papers, but if you&#8217;re Whispering Smith
it&#8217;s all right. I&#8217;m due to shoot out a little game
sometime with you at Medicine Bend, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Any time, Du Sang; only don&#8217;t let your hand
wabble next time. It&#8217;s too close to your gun now
to pull right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I told you I was going to come, didn&#8217;t
I? And I&#8217;m coming&ndash;&ndash;now!&#8221;</p>
<p>With the last word he whipped out his gun.
There was a crash of bullets. Questioned once
by McCloud and reproached for taking chances,
Whispering Smith answered simply. &#8220;I have to
take chances,&#8221; he said. &#8220;All I ask is an even
break.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Kennedy had said there was no such thing
as an even break with Whispering Smith. A few
men in a generation amuse, baffle, and mystify
other men with an art based on the principle that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
the action of the hand is quicker than the action
of the eye. With Whispering Smith the drawing
of a revolver and the art of throwing his shots
instantly from wherever his hand rested was pure
sleight-of-hand. To a dexterity so fatal he added
a judgment that had not failed when confronted
with deceit. From the moment that Du Sang first
spoke, Smith, convinced that he meant to shoot his
way through the line, waited only for the moment
to come. When Du Sang&#8217;s hand moved like a
flash of light, Whispering Smith, who was holding
his coat lapels in his hands, struck his pistol from
the scabbard over his heart and threw a bullet at
him before he could fire, as a conjurer throws a
vanishing coin into the air. Spurring his horse
fearfully as he did so, he dashed at Du Sang and
Karg, leaped his horse through their line and,
wheeling at arm&#8217;s length, shot again. Bill Dancing
jumped in his saddle, swayed, and toppled to
the ground. Stormy Gorman gave a single whoop
at the spectacle and, with his two cowboys at his
heels, fled for life.</p>

</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span></div>
<p>More serious than all, Smith found himself
among three fast revolvers, working from an unmanageable
horse. The beast tried to follow the
fleeing cowboys, and when faced sharply about
showed temper. The trained horses of the outlaws
stood like statues, but Smith had to fight with
his horse bucking at every shot. He threw his
bullets as best he could first over one shoulder and
then over the other, and used the last cartridge in
his revolver with Du Sang, Seagrue, and Karg
shooting at him every time they could fire without
hitting one another.</p>
<p>It was not the first time the Williams Cache
gang had sworn to get him and had worked together
to do it, but for the first time it looked as
if they might do it. A single chance was left to
Whispering Smith for his life, and with his coat
slashed with bullets, he took it. For an instant
his life hung on the success of a trick so appallingly
awkward that a cleverer man might have
failed in turning it. If his rifle should play free
in the scabbard as he reached for it, he could
fall to the ground, releasing it as he plunged from
the saddle, and make a fight on his feet. If the
rifle failed to release he was a dead man. To
so narrow an issue are the cleverest combinations
sometimes brought by chance. He dropped his
empty revolver, ducked like a mud-hen on his
horse&#8217;s neck, threw back his leg, and, with all the
precision he could summon, caught the grip of his
muley in both hands. He made his fall heavily to
the ground, landing on his shoulder. But as he
keeled from the saddle the last thing that rolled
over the saddle, like the flash of a porpoise fin, was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
the barrel of the rifle, secure in his hands. Karg,
on horseback, was already bending over him, revolver
in hand, but the shot was never fired. A
thirty-thirty bullet from the ground knocked the
gun into the air and tore every knuckle from
Karg&#8217;s hand. Du Sang spurred in from the right.
A rifle-slug like an axe at the root caught him
through the middle. His fingers stiffened. His
six-shooter fell to the ground and he clutched his
side. Seagrue, ducking low, put spurs to his horse,
and Whispering Smith, covered with dust, rose on
the battle-field alone.</p>
<p>Hats, revolvers, and coats lay about him. Face
downward, the huge bulk of Bill Dancing was
stretched motionless in the road. Karg, crouching
beside his fallen horse, held up the bloody stump
of his gun hand, and Du Sang, fifty yards away,
reeling like a drunken man in his saddle, spurred
his horse in an aimless circle. Whispering Smith,
running softly to the side of his own trembling
animal, threw himself into the saddle, and, adjusting
his rifle sights as the beast plunged down
the draw, gave chase to Seagrue.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
<h3>THE DEATH OF DU SANG</h3>
</div>
<p>Whispering Smith, with his horse in a
lather, rode slowly back twenty minutes
later with Seagrue disarmed ahead of him. The
deserted battle-ground was alive with men.
Stormy Gorman, hot for blood, had come back,
captured Karg, and begun swearing all over again,
and Smith listened with amiable surprise while he
explained that seeing Dancing killed, and not being
able to tell from Whispering Smith&#8217;s peculiar
tactics which side he was shooting at, Gorman
and his companions had gone for help. While
they angrily surrounded Karg and Seagrue, Smith
slipped from his horse where Bill Dancing lay,
lifted the huge head from the dust, and tried to
turn the giant over. A groan greeted the attempt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bill, open your eyes! Why would you not
do as I wanted you to?&#8221; he murmured bitterly to
himself. A second groan answered him. Smith
called for water, and from a canteen drenched the
pallid forehead, talking softly meanwhile; but his
efforts to restore consciousness were unavailing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
He turned to where two of the cowboys had
dragged Karg to the ground and three others had
their old companion Seagrue in hand. While two
held huge revolvers within six inches of his head,
the third was adjusting a rope-knot under his ear.</p>
<p>Whispering Smith became interested. &#8220;Hold
on!&#8221; said he mildly, &#8220;what is loose? What are
you going to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to hang these fellows,&#8221; answered
Stormy, with a volley of hair-raising imprecations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no! Just put them on horses under
guard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re going to do,&#8221; exclaimed the
foreman. &#8220;Only we&#8217;re going to run &#8217;em over to
those cottonwoods and drive the horses out from
under &#8217;em. Stand still, you tow-headed cow-thief!&#8221;
he cried, slipping the noose up tight on
George Seagrue&#8217;s neck.</p>
<p>&#8220;See here,&#8221; returned Whispering Smith, showing
some annoyance, &#8220;you may be joking, but I
am not. Either do as I tell you or release those
men.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I guess we are not joking very much.
You heard me, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221; demanded Stormy
angrily. &#8220;We are going to string these damned
critters up right here in the draw on the first tree.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whispering Smith drew a pocket-knife and
walked to Flat Nose, slit the rope around his neck,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
pushed him out of the circle, and stood in front of
him. &#8220;You can&#8217;t play horse with my prisoners,&#8221;
he said curtly. &#8220;Get over here, Karg. Come,
now, who is going to walk in first? You act like
a school-boy, Gorman.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hard words and a wrangle followed, but Smith
did not change expression, and there was a backdown.
&#8220;Have you fellows let Du Sang get away
while you were playing fool here?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Du Sang&#8217;s over the hill there on his horse, and
full of fight yet,&#8221; exclaimed one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we will look him up,&#8221; suggested Smith.
&#8220;Come, Seagrue.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go over there. He&#8217;ll get you if you
do,&#8221; cried Gorman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us see about that. Seagrue, you and Karg
walk ahead. Don&#8217;t duck or run, either of you.
Go on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just over the brow of the hill near which the
fight had taken place, a man lay below a ledge of
granite. The horse from which he had fallen was
grazing close by, but the man had dragged himself
out of the blinding sun to the shade of the
sagebrush above the rock&ndash;&ndash;the trail of it all lay
very plain on the hard ground. Watching him
narrowly, Smith, with his prisoners ahead and the
cowboys riding in a circle behind, approached.</p>
<p>&#8220;Du Sang?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span></div>
<p>The man in the sagebrush turned his head.</p>
<p>Smith walked to him and bent down. &#8220;Are
you suffering much, Du Sang?&#8221;</p>
<p>The wounded man, sinking with shock and internal
hemorrhage, uttered a string of oaths.</p>
<p>Smith listened quietly till he had done; then he
knelt beside him and put his hand on Du Sang&#8217;s
hand. &#8220;Tell me where you are hit, Du Sang.
Put your hand to it. Is it the stomach? Let me
turn you on your side. Easy. Does your belt
hurt? Just a minute, now; I can loosen that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you,&#8221; muttered Du Sang thickly.
Then his eyes&ndash;&ndash;terrible, rolling, pink eyes&ndash;&ndash;brightened
and he swore violently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Du Sang, you are not bleeding much, but I&#8217;m
afraid you are badly hit,&#8221; said Whispering Smith.
&#8220;Is there anything I can do for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get me some water.&#8221;</p>
<p>A creek flowed at no great distance below the
hill, but the cowboys refused to go for water.
Whispering Smith would have gone with Seagrue
and Karg, but Du Sang begged him not
to leave him alone lest Gorman should kill him.
Smith canvassed the situation a moment. &#8220;I&#8217;ll put
you on my horse,&#8221; said he at length, &#8220;and take
you down to the creek.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned to the cowboys and asked them to
help, but they refused to touch Du Sang.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span></div>
<p>Whispering Smith kept his patience. &#8220;Karg,
take that horse&#8217;s head,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Come here,
Seagrue; help me lift Du Sang on the horse. The
boys seem to be afraid of getting blood on their
hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>With Whispering Smith and Seagrue supporting
Du Sang in the saddle and Karg leading the
horse, the cavalcade moved slowly down to the
creek, where a tiny stream purled among the rocks.
The water revived the injured man for a moment;
he had even strength enough, with some help, to
ride again; and, moving in the same halting order,
they took him to Rebstock&#8217;s cabin. Rebstock,
at the door, refused to let the sinking man be
brought into the house. He cursed Du Sang as
the cause of all the trouble. But Du Sang cursed
him with usury, and, while Whispering Smith listened,
told Rebstock with bitter oaths that if he
had given the boy Barney anything but a scrub
horse they never would have been trailed. More
than this concerning the affair Du Sang would not
say, and never said. The procession turned from
the door. Seagrue led the way to Rebstock&#8217;s
stable, and they laid Du Sang on some hay.</p>
<p>Afterward they got a cot under him. With
surprising vitality he talked a long time to Whispering
Smith, but at last fell into a stupor. At
nine o&#8217;clock that night he sat up. Ed Banks and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
Kennedy were standing beside the cot. Du Sang
became delirious, and in his delirium called the
name of Whispering Smith; but Smith was at
Baggs&#8217;s cabin with Bill Dancing. In a spasm of
pain, Du Sang, opening his eyes, suddenly threw
himself back. The cot broke, and the dying man
rolled under the feet of the frightened horses. In
the light of the lanterns they lifted him back, but
he was bleeding slowly at the mouth, quite dead.</p>
<p>The surgeon, afterward, found two fatal wounds
upon him. The first shot, passing through the
stomach, explained Du Sang&#8217;s failure to kill at a
distance in which, uninjured, he could have placed
five shots within the compass of a silver dollar.
Firing for Whispering Smith&#8217;s heart, he had, despite
the fearful shock, put four bullets through
his coat before the rifle-ball from the ground,
tearing at right angles across the path of the
first bullet, had cut down his life to a question
of hours.</p>
<p>Bill Dancing, who had been hit in the head and
stunned, had been moved back to the cabin at Mission
Spring, and lay in the little bedroom. A doctor
at Oroville had been sent for, but had not come.
At midnight of the second day, Smith, who was
beside his bed, saw him rouse up, and noted the
brightness of his eyes as he looked around.
&#8220;Bill,&#8221; he declared hopefully, as he sat beside the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
bed, &#8220;you are better, hang it! I know you are.
How do you feel?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t that blamed doctor here yet? Then give
me my boots. I&#8217;m going back to Medicine Bend
to Doc Torpy.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the morning Whispering Smith, who had
cleansed and dressed the wound and felt sure the
bullet had not penetrated the skull, offered no objection
to the proposal beyond cautioning him to
ride slowly. &#8220;You can go down part way with
the prisoners, Bill,&#8221; suggested Whispering Smith.
&#8220;Brill Young is going to take them to Oroville,
and you can act as chairman of the guard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before the party started, Smith called Seagrue
to him. &#8220;George, you saved my life once. Do
you remember&ndash;&ndash;in the Pan Handle? Well, I gave
you yours twice in the Cache day before yesterday.
I don&#8217;t know how badly you are into this thing.
If you kept clear of the killing at Tower W I will
do what I can for you. Don&#8217;t talk to anybody.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>
<h3>McLOUD AND DICKSIE</h3>
</div>
<p>News of the fight in Williams Cache reached
Medicine Bend in the night. Horsemen,
filling in the gaps between telephones leading to
the north country, made the circuit complete, but
the accounts, confused and colored in the repeating,
came in a cloud of conflicting rumors. In the
streets, little groups of men discussed the fragmentary
reports as they came from the railroad
offices. Toward morning, Sleepy Cat, nearer the
scene of the fight, began sending in telegraphic
reports in which truth and rumor were strangely
mixed. McCloud waited at the wires all night,
hoping for trustworthy advices as to the result,
but received none. Even during the morning nothing
came, and the silence seemed more ominous
than the bad news of the early night. Routine
business was almost suspended and McCloud and
Rooney Lee kept the wires warm with inquiries,
but neither the telephone nor the telegraph would
yield any definite word as to what had actually
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
happened in the Williams Cache fight. It was
easy to fear the worst.</p>
<p>At the noon hour McCloud was signing letters
when Dicksie Dunning walked hurriedly up the
hall and hesitated in the passageway before the
open door of his office. He gave an exclamation
as he pushed back his chair. She was in her riding-suit
just as she had slipped from her saddle.
&#8220;Oh, Mr. McCloud, have you heard the awful
news? Whispering Smith was killed yesterday in
Williams Cache by Du Sang.&#8221;</p>
<p>McCloud stiffened a little. &#8220;I hope that can&#8217;t
be true. We have had nothing here but rumors;
perhaps it is these that you have heard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no! Blake, one of our men, was in the
fight and got back at the ranch at nine o&#8217;clock this
morning. I heard the story myself, and I rode
right in to&ndash;&ndash;to see Marion, and my courage failed
me&ndash;&ndash;I came here first. Does she know, do you
think? Blake saw him fall from the saddle after
he was shot, and everybody ran away, and Du
Sang and two other men were firing at him as
he lay on the ground. He could not possibly
have escaped with his life, Blake said; he must
have been riddled with bullets. Isn&#8217;t it terrible?&#8221;
She sobbed suddenly, and McCloud,
stunned at her words, led her to his chair and
bent over her.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span></div>
<p>&#8220;If his death means this to you, think of what
it means to me!&#8221;</p>
<p>A flood of sympathy bore them together. The
moment was hardly one for interruption, but the
despatcher&#8217;s door opened and Rooney Lee halted,
thunderstruck, on the threshold.</p>
<p>Dicksie&#8217;s hand disappeared in her handkerchief.
McCloud had been in wrecks before, and
gathered himself together unmoved. &#8220;What is
it, Rooney?&#8221;</p>
<p>The very calmness of the two at the table disconcerted
the despatcher. He held the message in
his hand and shuffled his feet. &#8220;Give me your
despatch,&#8221; said McCloud impatiently.</p>
<p>Quite unable to take his hollow eyes off Dicksie,
poor Rooney advanced, handed the telegram to
McCloud, and beat an awkward retreat.</p>
<p>McCloud devoured the words of the message
at a glance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; he cried, &#8220;this is from Gordon himself,
sent from Sleepy Cat. He must be safe and unhurt!
Listen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Three of the Tower W men trailed into Williams Cache.
In resisting arrest this morning, Du Sang was wounded and is
dying to-night. Two prisoners, Karg and Seagrue. G. S.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Those are Gordon&#8217;s initials; it is the signature
over which he telegraphs me. You see, this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
was sent last night long after Blake left. He is
safe; I will stake my life on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dicksie sank back while McCloud re-read the
message. &#8220;Oh, isn&#8217;t that a relief?&#8221; she exclaimed.
&#8220;But how can it be? I can&#8217;t understand
it at all; but he <i>is</i> safe, isn&#8217;t he? I was heartbroken
when I heard he was killed. Marion ought
to know of this,&#8221; she said, rising. &#8220;I am going
to tell her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And may I come over after I tell Rooney Lee
to repeat this to headquarters?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, of course, if you want to.&#8221;</p>
<p>When McCloud reached the cottage Dicksie
met him. &#8220;Katie Dancing&#8217;s mother is sick, and
she has gone home. Poor Marion is all alone this
morning, and half dead with a sick headache,&#8221;
said Dicksie. &#8220;But I told her, and she said she
shouldn&#8217;t mind the headache now at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what are you going to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going to get dinner; do you want to
help?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to help.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you are? That would be very funny.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Funny or not, I&#8217;m going to help.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You would only be in the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know whether I should or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know <i>I</i> should do much better if you would
go back and run the railroad a few minutes.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span></div>
<p>&#8220;The railroad be hanged. I am for dinner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I will get dinner for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You need not. I can get it for myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are perfectly absurd, and if we stand here
disputing, Marion won&#8217;t have anything to eat.&#8221;</p>
<p>They went into the kitchen disputing about what
should be cooked. At the end of an hour they
had two fires going&ndash;&ndash;one in the stove and one in
Dicksie&#8217;s cheeks. By that time it had been decided
to have a luncheon instead of a dinner. Dicksie
attempted some soup, and McCloud found a strip
of bacon, and after he had cooked it, Dicksie,
with her riding-skirt pinned up and her sleeves delightfully
rolled back, began frying eggs. When
Marion, unable longer to withstand the excitement,
appeared, the engineer, flushed with endeavor, was
making toast.</p>
<p>The three sat down at table together. They
found they had forgotten the coffee, but Marion
was not allowed to move from her chair. When
the coffee was made ready the bacon had been
eaten and more had to be fried. McCloud proved
able for any part of the programme, and when they
rose it was four o&#8217;clock and too late, McCloud
declared, to go back to the office that afternoon.</p>
<p>Marion and Dicksie, after a time, attempted
jointly to get rid of him, but they found they could
not, so the three talked about Whispering Smith.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
When the women tried to discourage McCloud by
talking hats he played the wheezy piano, and when
Dicksie spoke about going home he declared he
would ride home with her. But Dicksie had no
mind that he should, and when he asked to know
why, without realizing what a flush lingered in his
face, she said only, no; if she had reasons she
would give none. McCloud persisted, because
under the flush about his eyes was the resolve that
he would take one long ride that evening, in any
event. He had made up his mind for that ride&ndash;&ndash;a
longer one than he had ever taken before or expected
ever to take again&ndash;&ndash;and would not be
balked.</p>
<p>Dicksie, insisting upon going home, went so
far as to have her horse brought from the stable.
To her surprise, a horse for McCloud came over
with it. Quiet to the verge of solemnity, but with
McCloud following, Dicksie walked with admirable
firmness out of the shop to the curb. McCloud
gave her rein to her, and with a smile stood
waiting to help her mount.</p>
<p>She was drawing on her second glove. &#8220;You
are not going with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll let me ride the same road, won&#8217;t you&ndash;&ndash;even
if I can&#8217;t keep up?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dicksie looked at his mount. &#8220;It would be difficult
to keep up, with that horse.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Would you ride away from me just because
you have a better horse?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not <i>just</i> because I have a better horse.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked steadily at her without speaking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why must you ride home with me when I
don&#8217;t want you to?&#8221; she asked reproachfully.
Fear had come upon her and she did not know
what she was saying. She saw only the expression
of his eyes and looked away, but she knew that his
eyes followed her. The sun had set. The deserted
street lay in the white half-light of a mountain
evening, and the day&#8217;s radiance was dying in
the sky. In lower tones he spoke again, and she
turned deadly white.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve wanted so long to say this, Dicksie, that
I might as well be dead as to try to keep it back
any longer. That&#8217;s why I want to ride home with
you if you are going to let me.&#8221; He turned to
stroke her horse&#8217;s head. Dicksie stood seemingly
helpless. McCloud slipped his finger into his
waistcoat pocket and held something out in his
hand. &#8220;This shell pin fell from your hair that
night you were at camp by the bridge&ndash;&ndash;do you remember?
I couldn&#8217;t bear to give it back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dicksie&#8217;s eyes opened wide. &#8220;Let me see it. I
don&#8217;t think that is mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Great Heaven! Have I been carrying Marion
Sinclair&#8217;s pin for a month?&#8221; exclaimed McCloud.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
&#8220;Well, I won&#8217;t lose any time in returning
it to her, at any rate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; Dicksie&#8217;s voice was
faint.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to give Marion her pin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do nothing of the sort! Come here! Give it
to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dicksie, dare you tell me, after a shock like
that, it really <i>is</i> your pin?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know whose pin it is!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, what is the matter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me the pin!&#8221; She put her hands unsteadily
up under her hat. &#8220;Here, for Heaven&#8217;s
sake, if you must have something, take this comb!&#8221;
She slipped from her head the shell that held her
knotted hair. He caught her hand and kissed it,
and she could not get it away.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are dear,&#8221; murmured Dicksie, &#8220;if you
are silly. The reason I wouldn&#8217;t let you ride home
with me is because I was afraid you might get
shot. How do you suppose I should feel if you
were killed? Or don&#8217;t you think I have any
feeling?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Dicksie, is it all right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do I know? What do you mean? I
will not let you ride home with me, and you <i>will</i>
not let me ride home alone. Tie Jim again. I am
going to stay with Marion all night.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>
<h3>THE LAUGH OF A WOMAN</h3>
</div>
<p>Within an hour, Marion, working over a
hat in the trimming-room, was startled
to hear the cottage door open, and to see Dicksie
quite unconcernedly walk in. To Marion&#8217;s exclamation
of surprise she returned only a laugh. &#8220;I
have changed my mind, dear. I am going to stay
all night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marion kissed her approvingly. &#8220;Really, you
are getting so sensible I shan&#8217;t know you, Dicksie.
In fact, I believe this is the most sensible thing you
were ever guilty of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad you think so,&#8221; returned Dicksie dryly,
unpinning her hat. &#8220;I certainly hope it is. Mr.
McCloud persuaded me it wasn&#8217;t right for me to
ride home alone, and I knew better than he what
danger there was for him in riding home with me&ndash;&ndash;so
here I am. He is coming over for supper,
too, in a few minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>When McCloud arrived he brought with him a
porterhouse steak, and Marion was again driven
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span>
from the kitchen. At the end of an hour, Dicksie,
engrossed over the broiler, was putting the finishing
touches to the steak, and McCloud, more engrossed,
was watching her, when a diffident and
surprised-looking person appeared in the kitchen
doorway and put his hand undecidedly on the
casing. While he stood, Dicksie turned abruptly
to McCloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, by the way, I have forgotten something!
Will you do me a favor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly! Do you want money or a pass?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not money,&#8221; said Dicksie, lifting the steak
on her forks, &#8220;though you might give me a pass.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I should hate to have you go away anywhere&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to go anywhere, but I never had
a pass, and I think it would be kind of nice to have
one just to keep. Don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes; you might put it in the bank and
have it drawing interest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This steak is. Do they give interest on
passes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, a good deal of interest is felt in them&ndash;&ndash;on
this division at least. What is the favor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, what is it? How can I think? Oh, I
know! If they don&#8217;t put Jim in a box stall to-night
he will kill some of the horses over there.
Will you telephone the stables?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you give me the number and let me
telephone?&#8221; asked a voice behind them. They
turned in astonishment and saw Whispering Smith.
&#8220;I am surprised,&#8221; he added calmly, &#8220;to see a man
of your intelligence, George, trying to broil a steak
with the lower door of your stove wide open.
Close the lower door and cut out the draft through
the fire. Don&#8217;t stare, George; put back the
broiler. And haven&#8217;t you made a radical mistake
to start with?&#8221; he asked, stepping between the
confused couple. &#8220;Are you not trying to broil a
roast of beef?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you come from?&#8221; demanded McCloud,
as Marion came in from the dining-room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t search me the very first thing,&#8221; protested
Whispering Smith.</p>
<p>&#8220;But we&#8217;ve been frightened to death here for
twenty-four hours. Are you really alive and unhurt?
This young lady rode in twenty miles this
morning and came to the office in tears to get news
of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith looked mildly at Dicksie. &#8220;Did you shed
a tear for me? I should like to have seen just
one! Where did I come from? I reported in wild
over the telephone ten minutes ago. Didn&#8217;t Marion
tell you? She is so forgetful. That is what
causes wrecks, Marion. I have been in the saddle
since three o&#8217;clock this morning, thank you, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
have had nothing for five days but raw steer garnished
with sunshine.&#8221;</p>
<p>The four sat down to supper, and Whispering
Smith began to talk. He told the story of the
chase to the Cache, the defiance from Rebstock,
and the tardy appearance of the men he wanted.
&#8220;Du Sang meant to shoot his way through us
and make a dash for it. There really was nothing
else for him to do. Banks and Kennedy were
up above, even if he could have ridden out through
the upper canyon, which is very doubtful with all
the water now. After a little talk back and forth,
Du Sang drew, and of course then it was every
man for himself. He was hit twice and he died
Sunday night, but the other two were not seriously
hurt. What can you do? It is either kill
or get killed with those fellows, and, of course,
I talked plainly to Du Sang. He had butchered a
man at Mission Springs just the night before, and
deserved hanging a dozen times over. He meant
from the start, he told me afterward, to get me.
Oh, Miss Dunning, may I have some more coffee?
Haven&#8217;t I an agreeable part of the railroad business,
don&#8217;t you think? I shouldn&#8217;t have pushed in
here to-night, but I saw the lights when I rode by
awhile ago; they looked so good I couldn&#8217;t resist.&#8221;</p>
<p>McCloud leaned forward. &#8220;You call it pushing
in, do you, Gordon? Do you know what this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
young lady did this morning? One of her cowboys
came down from the Cache early with the
word that you had been killed in the fight by Du
Sang. He said he saw you drop from your saddle
to the ground with Du Sang shooting at you. She
ordered up her horse, without a word, and rode
twenty miles in an hour and a half to find out here
what we had heard. She &#8216;pushed in&#8217; at the
Wickiup, where she never had been before in her
life, and wandered through it alone looking for
my office, to find out from me whether I hadn&#8217;t
something to contradict the bad news. While we
talked, in came your despatch from Sleepy Cat.
Never was one better timed! And when she knew
you were safe her eyes filled again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whispering Smith looked at Dicksie quizzically.
Her confusion was delightful. He rose, lifted her
hand in his own, and, bending, kissed it.</p>
<p>They talked till late, and when Dicksie walked
out on the porch McCloud followed to smoke.
Whispering Smith still sat at the table talking to
Marion, and the two heard the sound of the low
voices outside. At intervals Dicksie&#8217;s laugh came
in through the open door.</p>
<p>Whispering Smith, listening, said nothing for
some time, but once she laughed peculiarly. He
pricked up his ears. &#8220;What has been happening
since I left town?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span></div>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; asked Marion Sinclair.</p>
<p>He nodded toward the porch. &#8220;McCloud and
Dicksie out there. They have been fixing things
up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense! What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean they are engaged.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never in the world!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I may be slow in reading a trail,&#8221; said Smith
modestly, &#8220;but when a woman laughs like that I
think there&#8217;s something doing. Don&#8217;t you believe
it? Call them in and ask them. You won&#8217;t?
Well, I will. Take them in separate rooms. You
ask her and I&#8217;ll ask him.&#8221;</p>
<p>In spite of Marion&#8217;s protests the two were
brought in. &#8220;I am required by Mr. Smith to ask
you a very silly question, Dicksie,&#8221; said Marion,
taking her into the living-room. &#8220;Answer yes or
no. Are you engaged to anybody?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What a question! Why, no!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Marion Sinclair wants to know just one thing,
George,&#8221; said Whispering Smith to McCloud
after he had taken him into the dark shop. &#8220;She
feels she ought to know because she is in a way
Dicksie&#8217;s chaperone, you know, and she feels that
you are willing she should know. I don&#8217;t want to
be too serious, but answer yes or no. Are you engaged
to Dicksie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes. I&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span></div>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all; go back to the porch,&#8221; directed
Whispering Smith. McCloud obeyed orders.</p>
<p>Marion, alone in the living-room, was waiting
for the inquisitor, and her face wore a look of triumph.
&#8220;You are not such a mind-reader after all,
are you? I told you they weren&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you they were,&#8221; contended Whispering
Smith.</p>
<p>&#8220;She says they are <i>not</i>,&#8221; insisted Marion.</p>
<p>&#8220;He says they are,&#8221; returned Whispering
Smith, &#8220;And, what&#8217;s more, I&#8217;ll bet my saddle
against the shop they are. I could be mistaken in
anything but that laugh.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>
<h3>A MIDNIGHT VISIT</h3>
</div>
<p>The lights, but one, were out. McCloud and
Whispering Smith had gone, and Marion
was locking up the house for the night, when she
was halted by a knock at the shop door. It was a
summons that she thought she knew, but the last
in the world that she wanted to hear or to answer.
Dicksie had gone to the bedroom, and standing
between the porti&egrave;res that curtained the work-room
from the shop, Marion in the half-light listened,
hesitating whether to ignore or to answer the
midnight intruder. But experience, and bitter experience,
had taught her there was only one way to
meet that particular summons, and that was to act,
whether at noon or at midnight, without fear. She
waited until the knocking had been twice repeated,
turned up the light, and going to the door drew
the bolt; Sinclair stood before her, and she drew
back for him to enter. &#8220;Dicksie Dunning is with
me to-night,&#8221; said Marion, with her hand on the
latch, &#8220;and we shall have to talk here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sinclair took off his hat. &#8220;I knew you had company,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
he returned in the low, gentle tone that
Marion knew very well, &#8220;so I came late. And
I heard to-night, for the first time, that this railroad
crowd is after me&ndash;&ndash;God knows why; but they
have to earn their salary somehow. I want to
keep out of trouble if I can. I won&#8217;t kill anybody
if they don&#8217;t force me to it. They&#8217;ve scared nearly
all my men away from the ranch already; one
crippled-up cowboy is all I have got to help me
look after the cattle. But I won&#8217;t quarrel with
them, Marion, if I can get away from here peaceably,
so I&#8217;ve come to talk it over once more with
you. I&#8217;m going away and I want you to go with
me; I&#8217;ve got enough to keep us as well as the best
of them and as long as we live. You&#8217;ve given me
a good lesson. I needed it, girlie&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t call me that!&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed kindly. &#8220;Why, that&#8217;s what it used
to be; that&#8217;s what I want it to be again. I don&#8217;t
blame you. You&#8217;re worth all the women I ever
knew, Marion. I&#8217;ve learned to appreciate some
few things in the lonely months I&#8217;ve spent up on
the Frenchman; but I&#8217;ve felt while I was there as
if I were working for both of us. I&#8217;ve got a buyer
in sight now for the cattle and the land. I&#8217;m ready
to clean up and say good-by to trouble&ndash;&ndash;all I want
is for you to give me the one chance I&#8217;ve asked
for and go along.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span></div>
<p>They stood facing each other under the dim
light. She listened intently to every word, though
in her terror she might not have heard or understood
all of them. One thing she did very clearly
understand, and that was why he had come and
what he wanted. To that she held her mind tenaciously,
and for that she shaped her answer. &#8220;I
cannot go with you&ndash;&ndash;now or ever.&#8221;</p>
<p>He waited a moment. &#8220;We always got along,
Marion, when I behaved myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you always will behave yourself; but
I could no more go with you than I could make
myself again what I was years ago, Murray. I
wish you nothing but good; but our ways parted
long ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop and think a minute, Marion. I offer you
more and offer it more honestly than I ever offered
it before, because I know myself better.
I am alone in the world&ndash;&ndash;strong, and better
able to care for you than I was when I undertook
to&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have never complained.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what makes me more anxious to show
you now that I can and will do what&#8217;s right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you multiply words! It is too late for
you to be here. You are in danger, you say; for
the love of Heaven, leave me and go away!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know me, Marion, when my mind is made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span>
up. I won&#8217;t leave without you.&#8221; He leaned with
one hand against the ribbon showcase. &#8220;If you
don&#8217;t want to go I will stay right here and pay off
the scores I owe. Two men here have stirred this
country up too long, anyway. I don&#8217;t care much
how soon anybody gets me after I round them up.
But to-night I felt like this: you and I started out in
life together, and we ought to live it out or die
together, whether it&#8217;s to-night, Marion, or twenty
years from to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want to kill me to-night, I have no resistance
to make.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sinclair sat down on a low counter-stool, and,
bending forward, held his head between his hands.
&#8220;It oughtn&#8217;t all to end here. I know you, and I
know you want to do what&#8217;s right. I couldn&#8217;t kill
you without killing myself; you know that.&#8221; He
straightened up slowly. &#8220;Here!&#8221; He slipped
his revolver from his hip-holster and held the grip
of the gun toward her. &#8220;Use it on me if you
want to. It is your chance to end everything; it
may save several lives if you do. I won&#8217;t leave
McCloud here to crow over me, and, by God, I
won&#8217;t leave you here for Whispering Smith! I&#8217;ll
settle with him anyhow. Take the pistol! What
are you afraid of? Take it! Use it! I don&#8217;t
want to live without you. If you make me do it,
you&#8217;re to blame for the consequences.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span></div>
<p>She stood with wide-open eyes, but uttered no
word.</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t touch it&ndash;&ndash;then you care a little for
me yet,&#8221; he murmured.</p>
<p>&#8220;No! Do not say so. But I will not do
murder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Think about the other, then. Go with me
and everything will be all right. I will come back
some evening soon for my answer. And until
then, if those two men have any use for life, let
them keep in the clear. I heard to-night that Du
Sang is killed. Do you know whether it is true?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is true.&#8221;</p>
<p>An oath half escaping showed how the confirmation
cut him. &#8220;And Whispering Smith got away!
It is Du Sang&#8217;s own fault; I told him to keep out
of that trap. I stay in the open; and I&#8217;m not Du
Sang. I&#8217;ll choose my own ground for the finish
when they want it with me, and when I go I&#8217;ll
take company&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;ll promise you that. Good-night,
Marion. Will you shake hands?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn it, I like your grit, girl! Well, good-night,
anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>She closed the door. She had even strength
enough to bolt it before his footsteps died away.
She put out the light and felt her way blindly back
to the work-room. She staggered through it,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span>
clutching at the curtains, and fell in the darkness
into Dicksie&#8217;s arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Marion dear, don&#8217;t speak,&#8221; Dicksie whispered.
&#8220;I heard everything. Oh, Marion!&#8221;
she cried, suddenly conscious of the inertness of
the burden in her arms. &#8220;Oh, what shall I do?&#8221;</p>
<p>Moved by fright to her utmost strength, Dicksie
drew the unconscious woman back to her room and
managed to lay her on the bed. Marion opened
her eyes a few minutes later to see the lights burning,
to hear the telephone bell ringing, and to find
Dicksie on the edge of the bed beside her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Marion, thank Heaven, you are reviving!
I have been frightened to death. Don&#8217;t mind the
telephone; it is Mr. McCloud. I didn&#8217;t know
what to do, so I telephoned him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you had better answer him,&#8221; said Marion
faintly. The telephone bell was ringing wildly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no! he can wait. How are you, dear? I
don&#8217;t wonder you were frightened to death. Marion,
he means to kill us&ndash;&ndash;every one!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Dicksie. He will kill me and kill himself;
that is where it will end. Dicksie, do answer the
telephone. What are you thinking of? Mr. McCloud
will be at the door in five minutes. Do you
want him in the street to-night?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dicksie fled to the telephone, and an excited conference
over the wire closed in seeming reassurance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span>
at both ends. By that time Marion had regained
her steadiness, but she could not talk of
what had passed. At times, as the two lay together
in the darkness, Marion spoke, but it was not to
be answered. &#8220;I do not know,&#8221; she murmured
once wearily. &#8220;Perhaps I am doing wrong; perhaps
I ought to go with him. I wish, oh, I wish
I knew what I ought to do!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>
<h3>THE CALL</h3>
</div>
<p>Beyond receiving reports from Kennedy and
Banks, who in the interval rode into town
and rode out again on their separate and silent
ways, Whispering Smith for two days seemed to
do nothing. Yet instinct keener than silence kept
the people of Medicine Bend on edge during those
two days, and when President Bucks&#8217;s car came
in on the evening of the second day, the town knew
from current rumors that Banks had gone to the
Frenchman ranch with a warrant on a serious
charge for Sinclair. In the president&#8217;s car Bucks
and McCloud, after a late dinner, were joined by
Whispering Smith, and the president heard the
first connected story of the events of the fortnight
that had passed. Bucks made no comment until
he had heard everything. &#8220;And they rode Sinclair&#8217;s
horses,&#8221; he said in conclusion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sinclair&#8217;s horses,&#8221; returned Whispering Smith,
&#8220;and they are all accounted for. One horse supplied
by Rebstock was shot where they crossed
Stampede Creek. It had given out and they had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span>
a fresh horse in the willows, for they shot the scrub
half a mile up one of the canyons near the crossing.
The magpies attracted my attention to it. A
piece of skin a foot square had been cut out of the
flank.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You got there before the birds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was about an even thing,&#8221; said Smith.
&#8220;Anyway, we were there in time to see the horse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Sinclair was away from the ranch from
Saturday noon till Sunday night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A rancher living over on Stampede Creek saw
the five men when they crossed Saturday afternoon.
The fellow was scared and lied to me about it, but
he told Wickwire who they were.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, who is Wickwire?&#8221; asked Bucks.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to remember Wickwire, George,&#8221;
remarked Whispering Smith, turning to McCloud.
&#8220;You haven&#8217;t forgotten the Smoky Creek wreck?
Do you remember the tramp who had his legs
crushed and lay in the sun all morning? You put
him in your car and sent him down here to the
railroad hospital and Barnhardt took care of him.
That was Wickwire. Not a bad fellow, either; he
can talk pretty straight and shoot pretty straight.
How do I know? Because he has told me the
story and I&#8217;ve seen him shoot. There, you see, is
one friend that you never reckoned on. He used
to be a cowboy, and I got him a job working for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span>
Sinclair on the Frenchman; he has worked at Dunning&#8217;s
and other places on the Crawling Stone.
He hates Sinclair with a deadly hatred for some
reason. Just lately Wickwire set up for himself
on Little Crawling Stone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have noticed that fellow&#8217;s ranch,&#8221; remarked
McCloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t leave him at Sinclair&#8217;s,&#8221; continued
Whispering Smith frankly. &#8220;The fellow was on
my mind all the time. I felt certain he would kill
Sinclair or get killed if he stayed there. And then,
when I took him away they sprang Tower W on
me! That is the price, not of having a conscience,
for I haven&#8217;t any, but of listening to the voice that
echoes where my conscience used to be,&#8221; said the
railroad man, moving uneasily in his chair.</p>
<p>Bucks broke the ash from his cigar into the tray
on the table. &#8220;You are restless to-night, Gordon&ndash;&ndash;and
it isn&#8217;t like you, either.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is in the air. There has been a dead calm
for two days. Something is due to happen to-night.
I wish I could hear from Banks; he started
with the papers for Sinclair&#8217;s yesterday while I
went to Oroville to sweat Karg. Blood-poisoning
has set in and it is rather important to us to get
a confession. There&#8217;s a horse!&#8221; He stepped to
the window. &#8220;Coming fast, too. Now, I wonder&ndash;&ndash;no,
he&#8217;s gone by.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span></div>
<p>Five minutes later a messenger came to the car
from the Wickiup with word that Kennedy was
looking for Whispering Smith. Bucks, McCloud,
and Smith left the car together and walked up to
McCloud&#8217;s office.</p>
<p>Kennedy, sitting on the edge of the table, was
tapping his leg nervously with a ruler. &#8220;Bad
news, Gordon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not from Ed Banks?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sinclair got him this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whispering Smith sat down. &#8220;Go on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Banks and I picked up Wickwire on the Crawling
Stone early, and we rode over to the Frenchman.
Wickwire said Sinclair had been up at
Williams Cache the day before, and he didn&#8217;t
think he was home. Of course I knew the Cache
was watched and he wouldn&#8217;t be there long, so
Ed asked me to stay in the cottonwoods and watch
the creek for him. He and Wickwire couldn&#8217;t find
anybody home when they got to the ranch-house
and they rode down the corral together to look
over the horses.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whispering Smith&#8217;s hand fell helplessly on the
table. &#8220;Rode down together! For God&#8217;s sake,
why didn&#8217;t <i>one</i> of them stay at the house?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sinclair rode out from behind the barn and
hit Wickwire in the arm before they saw him.
Banks turned and opened on him, and Wickwire
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span>
ducked for the creek. Sinclair put a soft bullet
through Banks&#8217;s shoulder&ndash;&ndash;tore it pretty bad, Gordon&ndash;&ndash;and
made his get-away before Wickwire and
I could reach the barn again. I got Ed on his
horse and back to Wickwire&#8217;s, and we sent one of
the boys to Oroville for a doctor. After Banks
fell out of the saddle and was helpless Sinclair
talked to him before I came up. &#8216;You ought to
have kept out of this, Ed,&#8217; he said. &#8216;This is a
railroad fight. Why didn&#8217;t they send the head of
their own gang after me?&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;naming you.&#8221; Kennedy
nodded toward Whispering Smith.</p>
<p>&#8220;Naming me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Banks says, &#8216;I&#8217;m sheriff of this county, and
will be a long time yet!&#8217; I took the papers from
his breast pocket,&#8221; continued Kennedy. &#8220;You can
see where he was hit.&#8221; Kennedy laid the sheriff&#8217;s
packet on the table. Bucks drew his chair forward
and, with his cigar between his fingers, picked
the packet up and opened it. Kennedy went on:
&#8220;Ed told Sinclair if he couldn&#8217;t land him himself
that he knew a man who could and would before
he was a week older. He meant you, Gordon,
and the last thing Ed told me was that he wanted
you to serve the papers on Sinclair.&#8221;</p>
<p>A silence fell on the company. One of the documents
passing under Bucks&#8217;s hand caught his eye
and he opened it. It was the warrant for Sinclair.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span>
He read it without comment, folded it, and, looking
at Whispering Smith, pushed it toward him.
&#8220;Then this, I guess, Gordon, belongs to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Starting from a revery, Whispering Smith
reached for the warrant. He looked for a moment
at the blood-stained caption. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;this, I guess, belongs to me.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>
<h3>DUTY</h3>
</div>
<p>The stir of the town over the shooting of
Banks seemed to Marion, in her distress,
to point an accusing finger at her. The disgrace
of what she had felt herself powerless to prevent
now weighed on her mind, and she asked herself
whether, after all, the responsibility of this murder
was not upon her. Even putting aside this
painful doubt, she bore the name of the man who
had savagely defied accountability and now, it
seemed to her, was dragging her with him through
the slough of blood and dishonor into which he
had plunged.</p>
<p>The wretched thought would return that had
she listened to him, had she consented to go away,
this outbreak might have been prevented. And
what horror might not another day bring&ndash;&ndash;what
lives still closer to her life be taken? For herself
she cared less; but she knew that Sinclair,
now that he had begun, would not stop. In whichever
way her thoughts turned, wretchedness was
upon them, and the day went in one of those despairing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span>
and indecisive battles that each one within
his own heart must fight at times with heaviness
and doubt.</p>
<p>McCloud called her over the telephone in the
afternoon to say that he was going West on the
evening train and would not be over for supper.
She wished he could have come, for her loneliness
began to be insupportable.</p>
<p>Toward sunset she put on her hat and started
for the post-office. In the meantime, Dicksie, at
home, had called McCloud up and told him she
was coming down for the night. He immediately
cancelled his plans for going West, and when
Marion returned at dusk she found him with Dicksie
at the cottage. The three had supper. Afterward
Dicksie and McCloud went out for a walk,
and Marion was alone in the house when the shop
door opened and Whispering Smith walked in. It
was dusk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t light the lamps, Marion,&#8221; he said, sitting
down on a counter-stool as he took off his hat.
&#8220;I want to talk to you just a minute, if you don&#8217;t
mind. You know what has happened. I am
called on now to go after Sinclair. I have tried
to avoid it, but my hand has been forced. To-day
I&#8217;ve been placing horses. I am going to ride to-night
with the warrant. I have given him a start
of twenty-four hours, hoping he may get out of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span>
the country. To stay here means only death to
him in the end, and, what is worse, the killing of
more and innocent men. But he won&#8217;t leave the
country; do you think he will?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I do not know! I am afraid he will not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not think I have ever hesitated before at
any call of this kind; nor at what such a call will
probably sometime mean; but this man I have
known since we were boys.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I had never seen him!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That brings up another point that has been
worrying me all day. I could not help knowing
what you have had to go through in this country.
It is a tough country for any woman. Your people
and mine were always close together and I have
felt bound to do what I could to&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid to say it&ndash;&ndash;make my path
easier.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Something like that, though there&#8217;s been little
real doing. What this situation in which Sinclair
is now placed may still mean to you I do not know,
but I would not add a straw to the weight of your
troubles. I came to-night to ask a plain question.
If he doesn&#8217;t leave the country I have got to meet
him. You know what, in all human probability,
that will mean. From such a meeting only one
of us can come back. Which shall it be?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t understand you&ndash;&ndash;do you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span>
ask me this question? How can I know which it
shall be? What is it you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean I will not take his life in a fight&ndash;&ndash;if
it comes to that&ndash;&ndash;if you would rather he should
come back.&#8221;</p>
<p>A sob almost refused an answer to him. &#8220;How
can you ask me so terrible a question?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a question that means a good deal to me,
of course, and I don&#8217;t know just what it means to
you: that is the point I am up against. I may have
no choice in the matter, but I must decide what to
try to do if I have one. Am I to remember first
that he is your husband?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a silence. &#8220;What shall I say&ndash;&ndash;what
can I say? God help me, how am I to answer a
question like that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How am I to answer it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her voice was low and pitiful when her answer
came: &#8220;You must do your duty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is my duty then? To serve the paper
that has been given to me, I know&ndash;&ndash;but not necessarily
to defend my life at the price of his. The
play of a chance lies in deciding that; I can keep
the chance or give it away; that is for you to
say. Or take the question of duty again. You
are alone and your friends are few. Haven&#8217;t I
any duty toward you, perhaps? I don&#8217;t know a
woman&#8217;s heart. I used to think I did, but I don&#8217;t.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span>
My duty to this company that I work for is only
the duty of a servant. If I go, another takes my
place; it means nothing except taking one name
off the payroll and putting another on. Whatever
he may have done, this man is your husband; if his
death would cause you a pang, it shall not be laid
at my door. We ought to understand each other
on that point fairly before I start to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you ask me whether you ought not to take
every means to defend your own life? or whether
any consideration ought to come before that? I
think not. I should be a wicked woman if I were
to wish evil to him, wretched as he has made me.
I am a wretched woman, whichever way I turn.
But I should be less than human if I could say
that to me your death would not be a cruel, cruel
blow.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence. &#8220;Dicksie understood
you to say that you were in doubt as to
whether you ought to go away with him when he
asked you to go. That is why I was unsettled in
my mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The only reason why I doubted was that I
thought by going I might save better lives than
mine. I could willingly give up my life to do that.
But to stain it by going back to such a man&ndash;&ndash;God
help me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I understand. If the unfortunate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_345' name='page_345'></a>345</span>
should happen before I come back I hope only
this: that you will not hate me because I am the
man on whom the responsibility has fallen. I
haven&#8217;t sought it. And if I should not come back
at all, it is only&ndash;&ndash;good-by.&#8221;</p>
<p>He saw her clasp her hands convulsively. &#8220;I
will not say it! I will pray on my knees that you
do come back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night, Marion. Some one is at the cottage
door.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is probably Mr. McCloud and Dicksie. I
will let them in.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII</h2>
<h3>WICKWIRE</h3>
</div>
<p>McCloud and Dicksie met them at the
porch door. Marion, unnerved, went
directly to her room. Whispering Smith stopped
to speak to Dicksie and McCloud interposed.
&#8220;Bob Scott telephoned the office just now he had
a man from Oroville who wanted to see you right
away, Gordon,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I told him to send him
over here. It is Wickwire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wickwire,&#8221; repeated Whispering Smith.
&#8220;Wickwire has no business here that I know of;
no doubt it is something I ought to know of.
And, by the way, you ought to see this man,&#8221; he
said, turning again to Dicksie. &#8220;If McCloud
tells the story right, Wickwire is a sort of prot&eacute;g&eacute;
of yours, Miss Dicksie, though neither of you
seems to have known it. He is the tramp cowboy
who was smashed up in the wreck at Smoky Creek.
He is not a bad man, but whiskey, you know, beats
some decent men.&#8221; A footstep fell on the porch.
&#8220;There he comes now, I reckon. Shall I let him
in a minute?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_347' name='page_347'></a>347</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I should like to see him! He has been
at the ranch at different times, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith opened the door and stepping out on the
porch, talked with the new-comer. In a moment
he brought him in. Dicksie had seated herself
on the sofa, McCloud stood in the doorway of
the dining-room, and Whispering Smith laid one
arm on the table as he sat down beside it with his
face above the dark shade of the lamp. Before
him stood Wickwire. The half-light threw him
up tall and dark, but it showed the heavy shock
of black hair falling over his forehead, and the
broad, thin face of a mountain man.</p>
<p>&#8220;He has just been telling me that Seagrue is
loose,&#8221; Whispering Smith explained pleasantly.
&#8220;Who turned the trick, Wickwire?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sheriff Coon and a deputy jailer started with
Seagrue for Medicine Bend this morning. Coming
through Horse Eye Canyon, Murray Sinclair
and Barney Rebstock got a clean drop on them,
took Seagrue, and they all rode off together. They
didn&#8217;t make any bones about it, either. Their gang
has got lots of friends over there, you know. They
rode into Atlantic City and stayed over an hour.
Coon tracked them there and got up a <i>posse</i> of six
men. The three were standing in front of the
bank when the sheriff rode into town. Sinclair and
Seagrue got on their horses and started off. Rebstock
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_348' name='page_348'></a>348</span>
went back to get another drink. When he
came out of the saloon he gave the <i>posse</i> a gun-fight
all by himself, and wounded two men and
made his get-away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whispering Smith shook his head, and his hand
fell on the table with a tired laugh. &#8220;Barney
Rebstock,&#8221; he murmured, &#8220;of all men! Coward,
skate, filler-in! Barney Rebstock&ndash;&ndash;stale-beer man,
sneak, barn-yard thief! Hit two men!&#8221; He
turned to McCloud. &#8220;What kind of a wizard is
Murray Sinclair? What sort of red-blood toxin
does he throw into his gang to draw out a spirit
like that? Murray Sinclair belongs to the race of
empire-builders. By Heaven, it is pitiful a man
like that should be out of a job! England, McCloud,
needs him. And here he is holding up
trains on the mountain division!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are all up at Oroville with the Williams
Cache gang, celebrating,&#8221; continued Wickwire.</p>
<p>Whispering Smith looked at the cowboy.
&#8220;Wickwire, you made a good ride and I thank
you. You are all right. This is the young lady
and this is the man who had you sent to the
hospital from Smoky Creek,&#8221; he added, rising.
&#8220;You can thank them for picking you up. When
you leave here tell Bob Scott to meet me at the
Wickiup with the horses at eleven o&#8217;clock, will
you?&#8221; He turned to Dicksie in a gentle aside. &#8220;I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_349' name='page_349'></a>349</span>
am riding north to-night&ndash;&ndash;I wish you were going
part way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dicksie looked at him intently. &#8220;You are
worried over something,&#8221; she murmured; &#8220;I can
see it in your face.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing more than usual. I thrive, you know,
on trouble&ndash;&ndash;and I&#8217;m sorry to say good-night so
early, but I have a long ride ahead.&#8221; He stepped
quietly past McCloud and out of the door.</p>
<p>Wickwire was thanking Dicksie when unwillingly
she let Whispering Smith&#8217;s hand slip out of
her own. &#8220;I shore wouldn&#8217;t have been here to-night
if you two hadn&#8217;t picked me up,&#8221; laughed
Wickwire, speaking softly to Dicksie when she
turned to him. &#8220;I&#8217;ve knowed my friends a long
time, but I reckon they all didn&#8217;t know me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve known you longer than you think,&#8221; returned
Dicksie with a smile. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen you at
the ranch-house. But now that we really do know
each other, please remember you are always sure
of a home at the ranch&ndash;&ndash;whenever you want one,
Mr. Wickwire, and just as long as you want one.
We never forget our friends on the Crawling
Stone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I may make so bold, I thank you kindly.
And if you all will let me run away now, I want
to catch Mr. Whispering Smith for just one
minute.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_350' name='page_350'></a>350</span></div>
<p>Wickwire overtook Smith in Fort Street.
&#8220;Talk quick, Wickwire,&#8221; he said; &#8220;I&#8217;m in a
hurry. What do you want?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Partner, I&#8217;ve always played fair with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So far as I know, Wickwire, yes. Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a favor to ask.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it&ndash;&ndash;money?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, partner, not money this time. You&#8217;ve
always been more than liberal with me. But so far
I&#8217;ve had to keep under cover; you asked me to. I
want to ask the privilege now of coming out into
the open. The jig is up so far as watching anybody
goes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nobody to watch any more&ndash;&ndash;they&#8217;re
all to chase, I reckon, now. The open is my kind
of a fight, anyway. I want to ride out this manhunt
with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How is your arm?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My arm is all right, and there ought to be a
place for me in the chase now that Ed Banks is
out of it. I want to cut loose up on the range,
anyhow; if I&#8217;m a man I want to know it, and
if I ain&#8217;t I want to know it. I want to ride
with you after Seagrue and Sinclair and Barney
Rebstock.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whispering Smith spoke coldly: &#8220;You mean,
Wickwire, you want to get killed.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_351' name='page_351'></a>351</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Why, partner, if it&#8217;s coming to me, I don&#8217;t
mind&ndash;&ndash;yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the use, Wickwire?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;m a man I want to know it; if I ain&#8217;t, it&#8217;s
time my friends knowed it. Anyhow, I&#8217;m man
enough to work out with some of that gang. Most
of them have put it over me one time or another;
Sinclair pasted me like a blackbird only the
other day. They all say I&#8217;m nothing but a damned
tramp. You say I have done you service&ndash;&ndash;give
me a show.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whispering Smith stopped a minute in the
shadow of a tree and looked keenly at him. &#8220;I&#8217;m
too busy to-night to say much, Wickwire,&#8221; he
said after a moment. &#8220;You go over to the barn
and report to Bob Scott. If you want to take the
chances, it is up to you; and if Bob Scott is agreeable,
I&#8217;ll use you where I can&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s all I can
promise. You will probably have more than one
chance to get killed.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII</h2>
<h3>INTO THE NORTH</h3>
</div>
<p>The moon had not yet risen, and in the darkness
of Boney Street Smith walked slowly
toward his room. The answer to his question had
come. The rescue of Seagrue made it clear that
Sinclair would not leave the country. He well
knew that Sinclair cared no more for Seagrue than
for a prairie-dog. It was only that he felt strong
enough, with his friends and sympathizers, to defy
the railroad force and Whispering Smith, and
planned now, probably, to kill off his pursuers or
wear them out. There was a second incentive for
remaining: nearly all the Tower W money had
been hidden at Rebstock&#8217;s cabin by Du Sang.
That Kennedy had already got hold of it Sinclair
could not know, but it was certain that he would
not leave the country without an effort to recover
the booty from Rebstock.</p>
<p>Whispering Smith turned the key in the door of
his room as he revolved the situation in his mind.
Within, the dark was cheerless, but he made no
effort to light a lamp. Groping his way to the side
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_353' name='page_353'></a>353</span>
of the low bed, he sat down and put his head between
his hands to think.</p>
<p>There was no help for it that he could see: he
must meet Sinclair. The situation he had dreaded
most, from the moment Bucks asked him to come
back to the mountains, had come.</p>
<p>He thought of every phase of the outcome. If
Sinclair should kill him the difficulties were less.
It would be unpleasant, certainly, but something
that might happen any time and at any man&#8217;s
hands. He had cut into the game too long ago
and with his eyes too wide open to complain at
this time of the possibility of an accident. They
might kill each other; but if, escaping himself, he
should kill Sinclair&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>He came back in the silence always to that if.
It rose dark between him and the woman he loved&ndash;&ndash;whom
he had loved since she was a child with
school-girl eyes and braided hair. After he had
lost her, only to find years afterward that she was
hardly less wretched in her life than he in his, he
had dreamed of the day when she might again be
free and he free to win a love long hoped for.</p>
<p>But to slay this man&ndash;&ndash;her husband&ndash;&ndash;in his inmost
heart he felt it would mean the raising of a
bar as impalpable as fate, and as undying, to all
his dreams. Deserved or not, whatever she should
say or not say, what would she feel? How could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_354' name='page_354'></a>354</span>
her husband&#8217;s death in that encounter, if it ever
came, be other than a stain that must shock and
wound her, no matter how much she should try
not to see. Could either of them ever quite forget
it?</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Kennedy and his men were guarding the Cache.
Could they be sent against Sinclair? That would
be only a baser sort of murder&ndash;&ndash;the murder of
his friends. He himself was leader, and so looked
upon; the post of danger was his.</p>
<p>He raised his head. Through the window came
a faint light. The moon was rising, and against
the inner wall of the room the straight, hard lines
of the old wardrobe rose dimly. The rifles were
within. He must choose.</p>
<p>He walked to the window and pushed the curtain
aside. It was dark everywhere across the
upper town, but in the distance one light burned.
It was in Marion&#8217;s cottage. He had chosen this
room because from the window he could see her
home. He stood for a few moments with his
hands in his pockets, looking. When he turned
away he drew the shade closely, lighted a lamp,
and unlocked the wardrobe door.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Scott left the barn at half-past ten with a led
horse for Whispering Smith. He rode past
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_355' name='page_355'></a>355</span>
Smith&#8217;s room in Fort Street, but the room was
dark, and he jogged down to the Wickiup square,
where he had been told to meet him. After waiting
and riding about for an hour, he tied the horses
and went up to McCloud&#8217;s office. McCloud was
at his desk, but knew nothing of Whispering Smith
except that he was to come in before he started.
&#8220;He&#8217;s a punctual man,&#8221; murmured Bob Scott, who
had the low voice of the Indian. &#8220;Usually he is
ahead of time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he in his room, do you think?&#8221; asked
McCloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;I rode around that way about fifteen minutes
ago; there was no light.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He must be there,&#8221; declared McCloud.
&#8220;Have you the horses below? We will ride over
and try the room again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fort Street back of Front is so quiet after
eleven o&#8217;clock at night that a footfall echoes in it.
McCloud dismounted in front of the bank building
and, throwing the reins to Bob Scott, walked
upstairs and back toward Smith&#8217;s room. In the
hallway he paused. He heard faint strains of
music. They came from within the room&ndash;&ndash;fragments
of old airs played on a violin, and subdued
by a mute, in the darkness. Instinct stayed McCloud&#8217;s
hand at the door. He stood until the
music ceased and footsteps moved about in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_356' name='page_356'></a>356</span>
room; then he knocked, and a light appeared
within. Whispering Smith opened the door. He
stood in his trousers and shirt, with his cartridge-belt
in his hand. &#8220;Come in, George. I&#8217;m just
getting hooked up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which way are you going to-night, Gordon?&#8221;
asked McCloud, sitting down on the chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going to Oroville. The crowd is celebrating
there. It is a d&eacute;fi, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you going to take with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody.&#8221;</p>
<p>McCloud moved uneasily. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There will be nothing doing. Sinclair may be
gone by the time I arrive, but I want to see Bob
and Gene Johnson, and scare the Williams Cache
coyotes, just to keep their tails between their legs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to kill off half a dozen of that gang.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whispering Smith said nothing for a moment.
&#8220;Did you ever have to kill a man, George?&#8221; he
asked buckling his cartridge-belt.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no reply. Smith had taken a rifle
from the rack and was examining the firing mechanism.
He worked the lever for a moment with
lightning-like speed, laid the gun on the bed, and
sat down beside it.</p>
<p>&#8220;You would hardly believe, George, how I hate
to go after Murray Sinclair. I&#8217;ve known him all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_357' name='page_357'></a>357</span>
my life. His folks and mine lived across the street
from one another for twenty years. Which is the
older? Murray is five years older than I am; he
was always a big, strong, good-looking fellow.&#8221;
Whispering Smith put his hands on the side of the
bed. &#8220;It is curious how you remember things
that happened when you were a boy, isn&#8217;t it? I
thought of something to-night I hadn&#8217;t thought
of for twenty years. A little circus came to town.
While they were setting up the tent the lines for
the gasolene tank got fouled in the block at the
top of the centre pole. The head canvasman
offered a quarter to any boy that would climb the
pole and free the block. One boy after another
tried it, but they couldn&#8217;t climb half-way up.
Then Murray sailed in. I was seven years old and
Murray was twelve, and he wore a vest. He gave
me the vest to hold while he went up. I felt like
a king. There was a lead-pencil in one pocket,
beautifully sharpened, and I showed it to the other
boys. Did he make good? He always made
good,&#8221; said Whispering Smith gloomily. &#8220;The
canvasman gave him the quarter and two tickets,
and he gave one of the tickets to me. I got to
thinking about that to-night. As boys, Murray
and I never had a quarrel.&#8221; He stopped. McCloud
said nothing, and, after an interval, Smith
spoke again:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_358' name='page_358'></a>358</span></div>
<p>&#8220;He was an oracle for all the small boys in
town, and could advise us on any subject on earth&ndash;&ndash;whether
he knew anything about it or nothing
about it made no difference. I told him once I
wanted to be a California stage-robber, and he replied
without an instant&#8217;s hesitation that I ought
to begin to practise running. I was so upset at his
grasp of the subject that I hadn&#8217;t the nerve to ask
him why I needed to practise running to be a stage-robber.
I was ashamed of appearing green and
to this day I&#8217;ve never understood what he meant.
Whether it was to run after the stage or to run
away from it I couldn&#8217;t figure out. Perhaps my
being too proud to ask the question changed my
career. He went away for a long time, and we
heard he was in the Black Hills. When he came
back, my God! what a hero he was.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob Scott knocked at the door and Whispering
Smith opened it. &#8220;Tired of waiting, Bob? Well,
I guess I&#8217;m ready. Is the moon up? This is the
rifle I&#8217;m going to take, Bob. Did Wickwire have
a talk with you? He&#8217;s all right. Suppose you
send him to the mouth of Little Crawling Stone
to watch things a day or two. They may try to
work north that way or hide in the wash.&#8221;</p>
<p>Walking down to the street, Whispering Smith
continued his suggestions. &#8220;And by the way,
Bob, I want you to pass this word for me up and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_359' name='page_359'></a>359</span>
down Front Street. Sinclair has his friends in
town and it&#8217;s all right&ndash;&ndash;I know them and expect
them to stay by him. I expect Murray&#8217;s friends
to do what they can for him. I&#8217;ve got my friends
and expect them to stay by me. But there is one
thing that I will not stand for on any man&#8217;s part,
and that is hiding Sinclair anywhere in Medicine
Bend. You keep him out of Medicine Bend, Bob;
will you do it? And remember, I will never let
up on the man who hides him in town while this
fight is on. There are good reasons for drawing
the line on that point, and there I draw it hard
and fast. Now Bob and Gene Johnson were at
Oroville when you left, were they, Bob?&#8221; He
was fastening his rifle in the scabbard. &#8220;Which
is deputy sheriff this year, Bob or Gene? Gene&ndash;&ndash;very
good.&#8221; He swung into the saddle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you got everything?&#8221; murmured Scott.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so. Stop! I&#8217;m riding away without
my salt-bag. That would be a pretty piece of business,
wouldn&#8217;t it? Take the key, Bob. It&#8217;s hanging
between the rifles and the clock. Here&#8217;s the
wardrobe key, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was some further talk when Scott came
back with the salt, chiefly about horses and directions
as to telephoning. Whispering Smith took
up a notch again in his belt, pulled down his hat,
and bent over the neck of his horse to lay his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_360' name='page_360'></a>360</span>
hand a moment in McCloud&#8217;s. It was one o&#8217;clock.
Across the foothills the moon was rising, and
Whispering Smith straightening up in the saddle
wheeled his horse and trotted swiftly up the street
into the silent north.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX</h2>
<h3>AMONG THE COYOTES</h3>
</div>
<p>Oroville once marked farthest north for
the Peace River gold camps, but with mining
long ago abandoned it now marks farthest
south for a rustler&#8217;s camp, being a favorite resort
for the people of the Williams Cache country.
Oroville boasts that it has never surrendered and
that it has never been cleaned out. It has moved,
and been moved, up stream and down, and from
bank to bank; it has been burned out and blown
away and lived on wheels: but it has never suffered
the loss of its identity. Oroville is said to
have given to its river the name of Peace River&ndash;&ndash;either
wholly in irony or because in Oroville there
was for many years no peace save in the river.
However, that day, too, is past, and Peace County
has its sheriff and a few people who are not
habitually &#8220;wanted.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whispering Smith, well dusted with alkali, rode
up to the Johnson ranch, eight miles southwest of
Oroville, in the afternoon of the day after he left
Medicine Bend. The ranch lies in a valley watered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_362' name='page_362'></a>362</span>
by the Rainbow, and makes a pretty little
oasis of green in a limitless waste of sagebrush.
Gene and Bob Johnson were cutting alfalfa when
Whispering Smith rode into the field, and, stopping
the mowers, the three men talked while the
seven horses nibbled the clover.</p>
<p>&#8220;I may need a little help, Gene, to get him out
of town,&#8221; remarked Smith, after he had told his
story; &#8220;that is, if there are too many Cache men
there for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob Johnson was stripping a stalk of alfalfa in
his fingers. &#8220;Them fellows are pretty sore.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That comes of half doing a job, Bob. I was
in too much of a hurry with the round-up. They
haven&#8217;t had dose enough yet,&#8221; returned Whispering
Smith. &#8220;If you and Gene will join me sometime
when I have a week to spare, we will go in
there, clean up the gang and burn the hair off the
roots of the chapparal&ndash;&ndash;what? I&#8217;ve hinted to
Rebstock he could get ready for something like
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell us about that fight, Gordon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will if you will give me something to eat
and have this horse taken care of. Then, Bob,
I want you to ride into Oroville and reconnoitre.
This is mail day and I understand some of the
boys are buying postage stamps to put on my
coffin.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_363' name='page_363'></a>363</span></div>
<p>They went to the house, where Whispering
Smith talked as he ate. Bob took a horse and
rode away, and Gene, with his guest, went back to
the alfalfa, where Smith took Bob&#8217;s place on the
mower. When they saw Bob riding up the valley,
Whispering Smith, bringing in the machine,
mounted his horse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your man is there all right,&#8221; said Bob, as he
approached. &#8220;He and John Rebstock were in the
Blackbird saloon. Seagrue isn&#8217;t there, but Barney
Rebstock and a lot of others are. I talked a few
minutes with John and Murray. Sinclair didn&#8217;t say
much; only that the railroad gang was trying to
run him out of the country, and he wanted to meet
a few of them before he went. I just imagined
he held up a little before me; maybe not. There&#8217;s
a dozen Williams Cache men in town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But those fellows are not really dangerous,
Bob, though they may be troublesome,&#8221; observed
Smith reflectively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what&#8217;s your plan?&#8221; blurted Gene
Johnson.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t any, Gene,&#8221; returned Smith, with
perfect simplicity. &#8220;My only plan is to ride into
town and serve my papers, if I can. I&#8217;ve got a
deputyship&ndash;&ndash;and that I&#8217;m going to do right away.
If you, Bob, or both of you, will happen in about
thirty minutes later you&#8217;ll get the news and perhaps
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_364' name='page_364'></a>364</span>
see the fun. Much obliged for your feed,
Gene; come down to Medicine Bend any time and
I&#8217;ll fill you up. I want you both for the elk hunt
next fall, remember that. Bucks is coming, and is
going to bring Brown and Henson and perhaps
Atterbury and Gibbs and some New Yorkers; and
McCloud&#8217;s brother, the preacher, is coming out
and they are all right&ndash;&ndash;all of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>The only street in Oroville faces the river, and
the buildings string for two or three blocks along
modest bluffs. Not a soul was anywhere in sight
when Whispering Smith rode into town, save that
across the street from where he dismounted and
tied his horse three men stood in front of the
Blackbird.</p>
<p>They watched the new arrival with languid interest.
Smith walked stiffly over toward the saloon
to size up the men before he should enter it.
The middle man of the group, with a thin red
face and very blue eyes, was chewing tobacco in an
unpromising way. Before Smith was half-way
across the street he saw the hands of the three men
falling to their hips. Taking care, however, only
to keep the men between him and the saloon door,
Smith walked directly toward them. &#8220;Boys, have
you happened to see Gene or Bob Johnson to-day,
any of you?&#8221; He threw back the brim of his
Stetson as he spoke.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_365' name='page_365'></a>365</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Hold your hand right there&ndash;&ndash;right where it
is,&#8221; said the blue-eyed man sharply.</p>
<p>Whispering Smith smiled, but held his hand
rather awkwardly upon his hat-brim.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; continued the spokesman, &#8220;we ain&#8217;t
none of us happened to see Bob or Gene Johnson
to-day; but we happen to seen Whispering Smith,
and we&#8217;ll blow your face off if you move it an inch.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith laughed. &#8220;I never quarrel with a man
that&#8217;s got the drop on me, boys. Now, this is
sudden but unexpected. Do I know any of you?&#8221;
He looked from one face to another before him,
with a wide reach in his field of vision for the three
hands that were fast on three pistol-butts. &#8220;Hold
on! I&#8217;ve met you somewhere,&#8221; he said with easy
confidence to the blue-eyed man with the weather-split
lip. &#8220;Williams Cache, wasn&#8217;t it? All right,
we&#8217;re placed. Now what have you got in for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got forty head of steers in for you,&#8221; answered
the man in the middle, with a splitting oath.
&#8220;You stole forty head of my steers in that round-up,
and I&#8217;m going to fill you so full of lead you&#8217;ll
never run off no more stock for nobody. Don&#8217;t
look over there to your horse or your rifle. Hold
your hands right where they are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, certainly!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I pull, I shoot!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t always do it, but it is business, I acknowledge.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_366' name='page_366'></a>366</span>
When a man pulls he ought to shoot&ndash;&ndash;very
often it&#8217;s the only chance he ever gets to
shoot. Well, it isn&#8217;t every man gets the drop on
me that easy, but you boys have got it,&#8221; continued
Whispering Smith in frank admiration. &#8220;Only I
want to say you&#8217;re after the wrong man. That
round-up was all Rebstock&#8217;s fault, and Rebstock
is bound to make good all loss and damage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll make good my share of it right now
and here,&#8221; said the man with the wash-blue eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, of course,&#8221; assented Whispering Smith,
&#8220;if I must, I must. I suppose I may light a cigarette,
boys, before you turn loose the fireworks?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Light it quick!&#8221;</p>
<p>Laughing at the humor of the situation, Whispering
Smith, his eyes beaming with good-nature,
put the finger and thumb of his right hand into
his waistcoat pocket, drew out a package of cigarette
paper, and, bantering his captors innocently
the while, tore out a sheet and put the packet back.
Folding the paper in his two hands, he declared
he believed his tobacco was in his saddle-pocket,
and asked leave to step across the street to get it.
The trick was too transparent, and leave was refused
with scorn and some hard words. Whispering
Smith begged the men in front of him in turn
for tobacco. They cursed him and shook their
heads.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_367' name='page_367'></a>367</span></div>
<p>For an instant he looked troubled. Still appealing
to them with his eyes, he tapped lightly the
lower outside pockets of his coat with his fingers,
shifting the cigarette paper from hand to hand as
he hunted. The outside pockets seemed empty.
But as he tapped the inside breast pocket on
the left side of the coat&ndash;&ndash;the three men, lynx-eyed,
watching&ndash;&ndash;his face brightened. &#8220;Stop!&#8221;
said he, his voice sinking to a relieved whisper as
his hand rested lightly on the treasure. &#8220;There&#8217;s
the tobacco. I suppose one of you will give me a
match?&#8221;</p>
<p>All that the three before him could ever afterward
recollect&ndash;&ndash;and for several years afterward
they cudgelled their brains pretty thoroughly about
that moment&ndash;&ndash;was that Whispering Smith took
hold of the left lapel of his coat to take the tobacco
out of the breast pocket. An excuse to take
that lapel in his left hand was, in fact, all that
Whispering Smith needed to put not alone the
three men before him but all Oroville at his
mercy. The play of his right hand in crossing the
corduroy waistcoat to pull his revolver from its
scabbard and throw it into their faces was all too
quick for better eyes than theirs. They saw only
the muzzle of the heavy Colt&#8217;s playing like a
snake&#8217;s tongue under their surprised noses, with
the good-natured smile still behind it. &#8220;Or will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_368' name='page_368'></a>368</span>
one of you roll a cigarette?&#8221; asked Whispering
Smith, without a break between the two questions.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t smoke. Now don&#8217;t make faces; go right
ahead. Do anything you want to with your hands.
I wouldn&#8217;t ask a man to keep his hands or feet
still on a hot day like this,&#8221; he insisted, the revolver
playing all the time. &#8220;You won&#8217;t draw?
You won&#8217;t fight? Pshaw! Then disengage your
hands gently from your guns. You fellows really
ought not to attempt to pull a gun in Oroville, and
I will tell you why&ndash;&ndash;there&#8217;s a reason for it.&#8221; He
looked confidential as he put his head forward to
whisper among the crestfallen faces. &#8220;At this altitude
it is too fast work. I know you now,&#8221; he
went on as they continued to wilt. &#8220;You are Fatty
Filber,&#8221; he said to the thin chap. &#8220;Don&#8217;t work
your mouth like that at me; don&#8217;t do it. You seem
surprised. Really, have you the asthma? Get
over it, because you are wanted in Pound County
for horse-stealing. Why, hang it, Fatty, you&#8217;re
good for ten years, and of course, since you have
reminded me of it, I&#8217;ll see that you get it. And
you, Baxter,&#8221; said he to the man on the right, &#8220;I
know I spoke to you once when I was inspector
about altering brands; that&#8217;s five years, you know.
You,&#8221; he added, scrutinizing the third man to
scare him to death&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;I think you were at Tower
W. No? No matter; you two boys may go, anyway.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_369' name='page_369'></a>369</span>
Fatty, you stay; we&#8217;ll put some state cow
on your ribs. By the way, are you a detective,
Fatty? Aren&#8217;t you? See here! I can get you
into an association. For ten dollars, they give
you a German-silver star, and teach the Japanese
method of pulling, by correspondence. Or you
might get an electric battery to handle your gun
with. You can get pocket dynamos from the mail-order
houses. Sure! Read the big book!&#8221;</p>
<p>When Gene and Bob Johnson rode into town,
Whispering Smith was sitting in a chair outside
the Blackbird, still chatting with Filber, who stood
with his arms around a hitching-post, holding fast
a mail-order house catalogue. A modest crowd
of hangers-on had gathered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here we are, Gene,&#8221; exclaimed Smith to the
deputy sheriff. &#8220;I was looking for steers, but
some calves got into the drive. Take him away.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the Johnsons were laughing, Smith
walked into the Blackbird. He had lost thirty
minutes, and in losing them had lost his quarry.
Sinclair had disappeared, and Whispering Smith
made a virtue of necessity by taking the upsetting
of his plans with an unruffled face. There was but
one thing more, indeed, to do, and that was to eat
his supper and ride away. The street encounter
had made so much talk in Oroville that Smith declined
Gene Johnson&#8217;s invitation to go back to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_370' name='page_370'></a>370</span>
house. It seemed a convenient time to let any
other ambitious rustlers make good if they were
disposed to try, and Whispering Smith went for
his supper to the hotel where the Williams Cache
men made their headquarters.</p>
<p>There was a rise in the atmospheric pressure the
moment he entered the hotel office door, and when
he walked into the dining-room, some minutes
later, the silence was oppressive. Smith looked
for a seat. The only vacant place chanced to be
at a table where nine men from the Cache sat busy
with ham and eggs. It was a trifle awkward, but
the only thing to do was to take the vacant chair.</p>
<p>The nine men were actively engaged with knives
and forks and spoons when Whispering Smith
drew out the empty chair at the head of the table;
but nine pairs of hands dropped modestly under
the table when he sat down. Coughing slightly to
hide his embarrassment and to keep his right hand
in touch with his necktie, Whispering Smith looked
around the table with the restrained air of a man
who has bowed his head and resolved to ask the
blessing, but wants to make reasonably sure that
the family is listening. A movement at the other
tables, among the regular boarders of the hostelry,
was apparent almost at once. Appetites began to
fail all over the dining-room. Whispering Smith
gave his order genially to the confused waitress:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_371' name='page_371'></a>371</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Bring me two eggs&ndash;&ndash;one fried on one side and
one on the other&ndash;&ndash;and coffee.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a general scraping of chairs on the
floor as they were pushed back and guests not at
the moment interested in the bill of fare started,
modestly but firmly, to leave the dining-room. At
Whispering Smith&#8217;s table there were no second
calls for coffee. To stimulate the eating he turned
the conversation into channels as reassuring as
possible. Unfortunately for his endeavor, the man
at the far end of the table reached for a toothpick.
It seemed a pleasant way out of the difficulty,
and when the run on toothpicks had once
begun, all Whispering Smith&#8217;s cordiality could not
check it. Every man appeared to want a toothpick,
and one after another of Whispering Smith&#8217;s
company deserted him. He was finally left alone
with a physician known as &#8220;Doc,&#8221; a forger and a
bigamist from Denver. Smith tried to engage
Doc in medical topics. The doctor was not alone
frightened but tipsy, and when Smith went so far
as to ask him, as a medical man, whether in his
opinion the high water in the mountains had any
direct connection with the prevalence of falling of
the spine among old &#8220;residenters&#8221; in Williams
Cache, the doctor felt of his head as if his brain
were turning turtle.</p>
<p>When Whispering Smith raised his knife ostentatiously
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_372' name='page_372'></a>372</span>
to bring out a feature of his theory, the
doctor raised his knife higher to admit the force
of it; and when Whispering Smith leaned his head
forward impressively to drive home a point in his
assertion, the doctor stretched his neck till his face
grew apoplectic. Releasing him at length from the
strain, Whispering Smith begged of the staring
maid-servant the recipe for the biscuit. When she
came back with it he sat all alone, pouring catsup
over his griddle-cakes in an abstracted manner, and
it so flurried her that she had to go out again to
ask whether the gasolene went into the dough or
under it.</p>
<p>He played out the play to the end, but when he
rode away in the dusk his face was careworn.
John Rebstock had told him why Sinclair dodged:
there were others whom Sinclair wanted to meet
first; and Whispering Smith was again heading on
a long, hard ride, and after a man on a better
horse, back to the Crawling Stone and Medicine
Bend. &#8220;There&#8217;s others he wants to see first or
you&#8217;d have no trouble in talking business to-day.
You nor no other man will ever get him alive.&#8221;
But Whispering Smith knew that.</p>
<p>&#8220;See that he doesn&#8217;t get you alive, Rebstock,&#8221;
was his parting retort. &#8220;If he finds out Kennedy
has got the Tower W money, the first thing he does
will be to put the Doxology all over you.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XL</h2>
<h3>A SYMPATHETIC EAR</h3>
</div>
<p>When Whispering Smith rode after Sinclair,
Crawling Stone Ranch, in common
with the whole countryside, had but one interest in
life, and that was to hear of the meeting. Riders
across the mountain valleys met with but one
question; mail-carriers brought nothing in their
pouches of interest equal to the last word concerning
Sinclair or his pursuer. It was commonly
agreed through the mountains that it would be a
difficult matter to overhaul any good man riding
Sinclair&#8217;s steel-dust horses, but with Sinclair himself
in the saddle, unless it pleased him to pull up,
the chase was sure to be a stern one. Against this
to feed speculation stood one man&#8217;s record&ndash;&ndash;that
of the man who had ridden alone across Deep
Creek and brought Chuck Williams out on a
buckboard.</p>
<p>Business in Medicine Bend, meantime, was
practically suspended. As the centre of all telephone
lines the big railroad town was likewise the
centre of all rumors. Officers and soldiers to and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_374' name='page_374'></a>374</span>
from the Fort, stage-drivers and cowmen, homesteaders
and rustlers, discussed the apprehension of
Sinclair. Moreover, behind this effort to arrest
one man who had savagely defied the law were
ranged all of the prejudices, sympathies, and
hatreds of the high country, and practically the
whole population tributary to Medicine Bend and
the Crawling Stone Valley were friends either to
Sinclair or to his pursuer. Behind Sinclair were
nearly all the cattlemen, not alone because he was
on good terms with the rustlers and protected his
friends, but because he warred openly on the
sheepmen. The big range interests, as a rule,
were openly or covertly friendly to Sinclair, while
against him were the homesteaders, the railroad
men, the common people, and the men who everywhere
hate cruelty and outrage and the making
of a lie.</p>
<p>Lance Dunning had never concealed his friendliness
for Sinclair, even after hard stories about
him were known to be true, and it was this confidence
of fellowship that made Sinclair, twenty-four
hours after he had left Oroville, ride down the
hill trail to Crawling Stone ranch-house.</p>
<p>The morning had been cold, with a heavy wind
and a dull sky. In the afternoon the clouds lowered
over the valley and a misting rain set in.
Dicksie had gone into Medicine Bend on the stage
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_375' name='page_375'></a>375</span>
in the morning, and, after a stolen half-hour
with McCloud at Marion&#8217;s, had ridden home to
escape the storm. Not less, but much more, than
those about her she was alive to the situation in
which Sinclair stood and its danger to those closest
to her. In the morning her one prayer to McCloud
had been to have a care of himself, and to
Marion to have a care of herself; but even when
Dicksie left them it seemed as if neither quite felt
the peril as she felt it.</p>
<p>In the afternoon the rain, falling steadily, kept
her in the house, and she sat in her room sewing
until the light failed. She went downstairs. Puss
had lighted the grate in the living-room, and Dicksie
threw herself into a chair. The sound of hoofs
aroused her and she went to a window. To
her horror, she saw Sinclair walking with her
cousin up to the front door. She ran into the dining-room,
and the two men entered the hall and
walked into the office. Choking with excitement,
Dicksie ran through the kitchen and upstairs to
master her agitation.</p>
<p>In the office Sinclair was sitting down before the
hot stove with a tumbler of whiskey. &#8220;Lance&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;he
shook his head as he spoke hoarsely&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;I
want to say my friends have stood by me to a
man, but there&#8217;s none of them treated me squarer
through thick and thin than you have. Well,

I&#8217;ve had some bad luck. It can&#8217;t be helped.
Regards!&#8221;</p>
<p>He drank, and shook his wet hair again. Four
days of hard riding had left no trace on his iron
features. Wet to the bone, his eyes flashed with
fire. He held the glassful of whiskey in a hand
as steady as a spirit-level and tossed it down a
throat as cool as dew.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to say another thing, Lance: I had no
more intention than a child of hurting Ed Banks.
I warned Ed months ago to keep out of this fight;
and I never knew he was in it till it was too late.
But I&#8217;m hoping he will pull through yet, if they
don&#8217;t kill him in the hospital to spite me. I never
recognized the men at all till it was too late.
Why, one of them used to work for me! A man
with the whole railroad gang in these mountains
after him has got to look out for himself or
his life ain&#8217;t worth a glass of beer. Thank you,
Lance, not any more. I saw two men, with their
rifles in their hands, looking for me. I hollered
at them; but, Lance, I&#8217;m rough and ready, as all
my friends know, and I will let no man put a drop
on me&ndash;&ndash;that I will never do. Ed, before I ever
recognized him, raised his rifle; that&#8217;s the only
reason I fired. Not so full, Lance, not so full, if
you please. Well,&#8221; he shook his black hair as he
threw back his head, &#8220;here&#8217;s to better luck in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_377' name='page_377'></a>377</span>
worse countries!&#8221; He paused as he swallowed,
and set the tumbler down. &#8220;Lance, I&#8217;m saying
good-by to the mountains.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not going away for good, Murray?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going away for good. What&#8217;s the use?
For two years these railroad cutthroats have been
trying to put something on me; you know that.
They&#8217;ve been trying to mix me up with that bridge-burning
at Smoky Creek; Sugar Buttes, they had
me there; Tower W&ndash;&ndash;nothing would do but I was
there, and they&#8217;ve got one of the men in jail down
there now, Lance, trying to sweat enough perjury
out of him to send me up. What show has a poor
man got against all the money there is in the country?
I wouldn&#8217;t be afraid of a jury of my own
neighbors&ndash;&ndash;the men that know me, Lance&ndash;&ndash;any
time. What show would I have with a packed
jury in Medicine Bend? I could explain anything
I&#8217;ve done to the satisfaction of any reasonable
man. I&#8217;m human, Lance; that&#8217;s all I say. I&#8217;ve
been mistreated and I don&#8217;t forget it. They&#8217;ve
even turned my wife against me&ndash;&ndash;as fine a woman
as ever lived.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lance swore sympathetically. &#8220;There&#8217;s good
stuff in you yet, Murray.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to say good-by to the mountains,&#8221;
Sinclair went on grimly, &#8220;but I&#8217;m going to Medicine
Bend to-night and tell the man that has
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_378' name='page_378'></a>378</span>
hounded me what I think of him before I leave.
I&#8217;m going to give my wife a chance to do what is
right and go with me. She&#8217;s been poisoned against
me&ndash;&ndash;I know that; but if she does what&#8217;s fair and
square there&#8217;ll be no trouble&ndash;&ndash;no trouble at all.
All I want, Lance, is a square deal. What?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dicksie with her pulses throbbing at fever-heat
heard the words. She stood half-way down
the stairs, trembling as she listened. Anger,
hatred, the spirit of vengeance, choked in her
throat at the sinister words. She longed to stride
into the room and confront the murderer and call
down retribution on his head. It was no fear of
him that restrained her, for the Crawling Stone
girl never knew fear. She would have confronted
him and denounced him, but prudence checked her
angry impulse. She knew what he meant to do&ndash;&ndash;to
ride into Medicine Bend under cover of the
storm, murder the two he hated, and escape in the
night; and she resolved he should never succeed.
If she could only get to the telephone! But the
telephone was in the room where he sat. He was
saying good-by. Her cousin was trying to dissuade
him from riding out into the storm, but he
was going. The door opened; the men went out
on the porch, and it closed. Dicksie, lightly as a
shadow, ran into the office and began ringing
Medicine Bend on the telephone.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLI</h2>
<h3>DICKSIE&#8217;S RIDE</h3>
</div>
<p>When Lance Dunning entered the room ten
minutes later, Dicksie stood at the telephone;
but the ten minutes of that interval had
made quite another creature of his cousin. The
wires were down and no one from any quarter gave
a response to her frantic ringing. Through the
receiver she could hear only the sweep of the rain
and the harsh crackle of the wind. Sometimes
praying, sometimes fainting, and sometimes despairing,
she stood clinging to the instrument,
ringing and pounding upon it like one frenzied.
Lance looked at her in amazement. &#8220;Why, God
a&#8217;mighty, Dicksie, what&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;</p>
<p>He called twice to her before she turned, and
her words almost stunned him: &#8220;Why did you not
detain Sinclair here to-night? Why did you not
arrest him?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lance&#8217;s sombrero raked heavily to one side of
his face, and one end of his mustache running up
much higher on the other did not begin to express
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_380' name='page_380'></a>380</span>
his astonishment. &#8220;Arrest him? Arrest Sinclair?
Dicksie, are you crazy? Why the devil
should I arrest Sinclair? Do you suppose I am
going to mix up in a fight like this? Do you think
<i>I</i> want to get killed? The level-headed man in
this country, just at present, is the man who can
keep out of trouble, and the man who succeeds, let
me tell you, has got more than plenty to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lance, getting no answer but a fierce, searching
gaze from Dicksie&#8217;s wild eyes, laid his hand on a
chair, lighted a cigar, and sat down before the fire.
Dicksie dropped the telephone receiver, put her
hand to her girdle, and looked at him. When she
spoke her tone was stinging. &#8220;You know that
man is going to Medicine Bend to kill his
wife!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lance took the cigar from his mouth and returned
her look. &#8220;I know no such thing,&#8221; he
growled curtly.</p>
<p>&#8220;And to kill George McCloud, if he can.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stared without reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;You heard him say so,&#8221; persisted Dicksie
vehemently.</p>
<p>Lance crossed his legs and threw back the brim
of his hat. &#8220;McCloud is nobody&#8217;s fool. He will
look out for himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;These fiendish wires to Medicine Bend are
down. Why hasn&#8217;t this line been repaired?&#8221; she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_381' name='page_381'></a>381</span>
cried, wringing her hands. &#8220;There is no way to
give warning to any one that he is coming, and
you have let him go!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lance whirled in his chair. &#8220;Damnation!
Could I keep him from going?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You did not want to; you are keeping out of
trouble. What do you care whom he kills to-night!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve gone crazy, Dicksie. Your imagination
has upset your reason. Whether he
kills anybody to-night or not, it&#8217;s too late now
to make a row about it,&#8221; exclaimed Lance,
throwing his cigar angrily away. &#8220;He won&#8217;t
kill us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you expect me to sit by and fold my
hands while that wretch sheds more blood, do
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be helped.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I say it can be helped! I can help it&ndash;&ndash;I will
help it&ndash;&ndash;as you could have done if you had wanted
to. I will ride to Medicine Bend to-night and
help it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lance jumped to his feet, with a string of oaths.
&#8220;Well this is the limit!&#8221; He pointed his finger
at her. &#8220;Dicksie Dunning, you won&#8217;t stir out of
this house to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her face hardened. &#8220;How dare you speak in
that way to me? Who are you, that you order me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_382' name='page_382'></a>382</span>
what to do, where to stay? Am I your cowboy,
to be defiled with your curses?&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at her in amazement. She was only
eighteen; he would still face her down. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell
you who I am. I am master here, and you will
do as I tell you. You will ride to Medicine Bend
to-night, will you?&#8221; He struck the table with his
clinched fist. &#8220;Do you hear me? I say, by God,
not a horse shall leave this ranch in this storm to-night
to go anywhere for anybody or with anybody!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I say to you this ranch is my ranch, and
these horses are my horses! From this hour forth
I will order them to go and come when and where
I please!&#8221; She stepped toward him. &#8220;Henceforward
I am mistress here. Do you hear me?
Henceforward <i>I</i> give orders in Crawling Stone
House, and every one under this roof takes orders
from me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dicksie, what do you mean? For God&#8217;s sake,
you&#8217;re not going to try to ride&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She swept from the room. What happened
afterward she could never recall. Who got Jim
for her or whether she got the horse up herself,
what was said to her in low, kindly words of warning
by the man at Jim&#8217;s neck when she sprang into
the saddle, who the man was, she could not have
told. All she felt at last was that she was free
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_383' name='page_383'></a>383</span>
and out under the black sky, with the rain beating
her burning face and her horse leaping fearfully
into the wind.</p>
<p>No man could have kept the trail to the pass
that night. The horse took it as if the path flashed
in sunshine, and swung into the familiar stride that
had carried her so many times over the twenty
miles ahead of them. The storm driving into
Dicksie&#8217;s face cooled her. Every moment she recollected
herself better, and before her mind all the
aspects of her venture ranged themselves. She
had set herself to a race, and against her rode the
hardest rider in the mountains. She had set herself
to what few men on the range would have
dared and what no other woman on the range
could do. &#8220;Why have I learned to ride,&#8221; went
the question through her mind, &#8220;if not for this&ndash;&ndash;for
those I love and for those who love me?&#8221;
Sinclair had a start, she well knew, but not so much
for a night like this night. He would ride to kill
those he hated; she would ride to save those she
loved. Her horse already was on the Elbow
grade; she knew it from his shorter spring&ndash;&ndash;a lithe,
creeping spring that had carried her out of deep
canyons and up long draws where other horses
walked. The wind lessened and the rain drove
less angrily in her face. She patted Jim&#8217;s neck
with her wet glove, and checked him as tenderly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_384' name='page_384'></a>384</span>
as a lover, to give him courage and breath. She
wanted to be part of him as he strove, for the
horror of the night began to steal on the edge
of her thoughts. A gust drove into her face.
They were already at the head of the pass,
and the horse, with level ground underfoot, was
falling into the long reach; but the wind was
colder.</p>
<p>Dicksie lowered her head and gave Jim the rein.
She realized how wet she was; her feet and her
knees were wet. She had no protection but her
skirt, though the meanest rider on all her countless
acres would not have braved a mile on such a
night without leather and fur. The great lapels
of her riding-jacket, reversed, were buttoned tight
across her shoulders, and the double fold of fur
lay warm and dry against her heart and lungs;
but her hands were cold, and her skirt dragged
leaden and cold from her waist, and water soaked
in upon her chilled feet. She knew she ought to
have thought of these things. She planned, as
thought swept in a moving picture across her brain,
how she would prepare again for such a ride&ndash;&ndash;with
her cowboy costume that she had once masqueraded
in for Marion, with leggings of buckskin
and &#8220;chaps&#8221; of long white silken wool. It
was no masquerade now&ndash;&ndash;she was riding in deadly
earnest; and her lips closed to shut away a creepy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_385' name='page_385'></a>385</span>
feeling that started from her heart and left her
shivering.</p>
<p>She became conscious of how fast she was going.
Instinct, made keen by thousands of saddle miles,
told Dicksie of her terrific pace. She was riding
faster than she would have dared go at noonday
and without thought or fear of accident. In spite
of the sliding and the plunging down the long hill,
the storm and the darkness brought no thought of
fear for herself; her only fear was for those ahead.
In supreme moments a horse, like a man when
human efforts become superhuman, puts the lesser
dangers out of reckoning, and the faculties, set on
a single purpose, though strained to the breaking-point,
never break. Low in her saddle, Dicksie
tried to reckon how far they had come and how
much lay ahead. She could feel her skirt stiffening
about her knees, and the rain beating at her
face was sharper; she knew the sleet as it stung
her cheeks, and knew what next was coming&ndash;&ndash;the
snow.</p>
<p>There was no need to urge Jim. He had the
rein and Dicksie bent down to speak to him, as
she often spoke when they were alone on the road,
when Jim, bolting, almost threw her. Recovering
instantly, she knew they were no longer alone.
She rose alert in her seat. Her straining eyes
could see nothing. Was there a sound in the wind?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_386' name='page_386'></a>386</span>
She held her breath to listen, but before she could
apprehend Jim leaped violently ahead. Dicksie
screamed in an agony of terror. She knew then
that she had passed another rider, and so close she
might have touched him.</p>
<p>Fear froze her to the saddle; it lent wings to
her horse. The speed became wild. Dicksie knit
herself to her dumb companion and a prayer
choked in her throat. She crouched lest a bullet
tear her from her horse; but through the darkness
no bullet came, only the sleet, stinging her face,
stiffening her gloves, freezing her hair, chilling
her limbs, and weighting her like lead on her struggling
horse. She knew not even Sinclair could
overtake her now&ndash;&ndash;that no living man could lay
a hand on her bridle-rein&ndash;&ndash;and she pulled Jim in
down the winding hills to save him for the long
flat. When they struck it they had but four miles
to go.</p>
<p>Across the flat the wind drove in fury. Reflection,
thought, and reason were beginning to leave
her. She was crying to herself quietly as she used
to cry when she lost herself, a mere child, riding
among the hills. She was praying meaningless
words. Snow purred softly on her cheeks. The cold
was soothing her senses. Unable at last to keep
her seat on the horse, she stopped him, slipped
stiffly to the ground, and, struggling through the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_387' name='page_387'></a>387</span>
wind as she held fast to the bridle and the horn,
half walked and half ran to start the blood
through her benumbed veins. She struggled until
she could drag her mired feet no farther, and tried
to draw herself back into the saddle. It was almost
beyond her. She sobbed and screamed at
her helplessness. At last she managed to climb
flounderingly back into her seat, and, bending her
stiffened arms to Jim&#8217;s neck, she moaned and cried
to him. When again she could hold her seat no
longer, she fell to the horse&#8217;s side, dragged herself
along in the frozen slush, and, screaming with the
pain of her freezing hands, drew herself up into
the saddle.</p>
<p>She knew that she dare not venture this again&ndash;&ndash;that
if she did so she could never remount. She
felt now that she should never live to reach Medicine
Bend. She rode on and on and on&ndash;&ndash;would
it never end? She begged God to send a painless
death to those she rode to save, and when the
prayer passed her failing senses a new terror
awakened her, for she found herself falling out of
the saddle. With excruciating torment she recovered
her poise. Reeling from side to side, she
fought the torpor away. Her mind grew clearer
and her tears had ceased. She prayed for a light.
The word caught between her stiffened lips and
she mumbled it till she could open them wide and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_388' name='page_388'></a>388</span>
scream it out. Then came a sound like the beating
of great drums in her ears. It was the crash of
Jim&#8217;s hoofs on the river bridge, and she was in
Medicine Bend.</p>
<p>A horse, galloping low and heavily, slued
through the snow from Fort Street into Boney,
and, where it had so often stopped before, dashed
up on the sidewalk in front of the little shop. The
shock was too much for its unconscious rider, and,
shot headlong from her saddle, Dicksie was flung
bruised and senseless against Marion&#8217;s door.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />

<a name='CHAPTER_XLII_AT_THE_DOOR' id='CHAPTER_XLII_AT_THE_DOOR'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XLII</h2>
<h3>AT THE DOOR</h3>
</div>
<p>She woke in a dream of hoofs beating at her
brain. Distracted words fell from her lips,
and when she opened her swollen eyes and saw
those about her she could only scream.</p>
<p>Marion had called up the stable, but the stablemen
could only tell her that Dicksie&#8217;s horse, in
terrible condition, had come in riderless. While
Barnhardt, the railway surgeon, at the bedside administered
restoratives, Marion talked with him of
Dicksie&#8217;s sudden and mysterious coming. Dicksie,
lying in pain and quite conscious, heard all, but,
unable to explain, moaned in her helplessness. She
heard Marion at length tell the doctor that McCloud
was out of town, and the news seemed to
bring back her senses. Then, rising in the bed,
while the surgeon and Marion coaxed her to lie
down, she clutched at their arms and, looking from
one to the other, told her story. When it was
done she swooned, but she woke to hear voices
at the door of the shop. She heard as if she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_390' name='page_390'></a>390</span>
dreamed, but at the door the words were dread
reality. Sinclair had made good his word, and
had come out of the storm with a summons
upon Marion and it was the surgeon who threw
open the door and saw Sinclair standing in the
snow.</p>
<p>No man in Medicine Bend knew Sinclair more
thoroughly or feared him less than Barnhardt.
No man could better meet him or speak to him
with less of hesitation. Sinclair, as he faced Barnhardt,
was not easy in spite of his dogged self-control;
and he was standing, much to his annoyance,
in the glare of an arc-light that swung across
the street in front of the shop. He was well aware
that no such light had ever swung within a block
of the shop before and in it he saw the hand of
Whispering Smith. The light was unexpected,
Barnhardt was a surprise, and even the falling
snow, which protected him from being seen twenty
feet away, angered him. He asked curtly who
was ill, and without awaiting an answer asked for
his wife.</p>
<p>The surgeon eyed him coldly. &#8220;Sinclair, what
are you doing in Medicine Bend? Have you
come to surrender yourself?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Surrender myself? Yes, I&#8217;m ready any time
to surrender myself. Take me along yourself,
Barnhardt, if you think I&#8217;ve done worse than any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_391' name='page_391'></a>391</span>
man would that has been hounded as I&#8217;ve been
hounded. I want to see my wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sinclair, you can&#8217;t see your wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter&ndash;&ndash;is she sick?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but you can&#8217;t see her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who says I can&#8217;t see her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I say so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sinclair swept the ice furiously from his beard
and his right hand fell to his hip as he stepped
back. &#8220;You&#8217;ve turned against me too, have you,
you gray-haired wolf? Can&#8217;t see her! Get out
of that door.&#8221;</p>
<p>The surgeon pointed his finger at the murderer.
&#8220;No, I won&#8217;t get out of this door. Shoot, you
coward! Shoot an unarmed man. You will not
live to get a hundred feet away. This place is
watched for you; you could not have got within
a hundred yards of it to-night except for this
snow.&#8221; Barnhardt pointed through the storm.
&#8220;Sinclair, you will hang in the court-house square,
and I will take the last beat of your pulse with
these fingers, and when I pronounce you dead they
will cut you down. You want to see your wife.
You want to kill her. Don&#8217;t lie; you want to kill
her. You were heard to say as much to-night
at the Dunning ranch. You were watched and
tracked, and you are expected and looked for
here. Your best friends have gone back on you.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_392' name='page_392'></a>392</span>
Ay, curse again and over again, but that will not
put Ed Banks on his feet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sinclair stamped with frenzied oaths. &#8220;You&#8217;re
too hard on me,&#8221; he cried, clenching his hands.
&#8220;I say you&#8217;re too hard. You&#8217;ve heard one side
of it. Is that the way you put judgment on a man
that&#8217;s got no friends left because they start a new
lie on him every day? Who is it that&#8217;s watching
me? Let them stand out like men in the open.
If they want me, let them come like men and take
me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sinclair, this storm gives you a chance to
get away; take it. Bad as you are, there are men
in Medicine Bend who knew you when you were
a man. Don&#8217;t stay here for some of them to sit
on the jury that hangs you. If you can get away,
get away. If I were your friend&ndash;&ndash;and God knows
whom you can call friend in Medicine Bend to-night&ndash;&ndash;I
couldn&#8217;t say more. Get away before it
is too late.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was never again seen alive in Medicine
Bend. They tracked him next day over every foot
of ground he had covered. They found where he
had left his spent horse and where afterward he
had got the fresh one. They learned how he had
eluded all the picketing planned for precisely such
a contingency, got into the Wickiup, got upstairs
and burst open the very door of McCloud&#8217;s room.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_393' name='page_393'></a>393</span>
But Dicksie had on her side that night One greater
than her invincible will or her faithful horse.
McCloud was two hundred miles away.</p>
<p>Barnhardt lost no time in telephoning the Wickiup
that Sinclair was in town, but within an hour,
while the two women were still under the surgeon&#8217;s
protection, a knock at the cottage door gave them
a second fright. Barnhardt answered the summons.
He opened the door and, as the man outside
paused to shake the snow off his hat, the surgeon
caught him by the shoulder and dragged into
the house Whispering Smith.</p>
<p>Picking the icicles from his hair, Smith listened
to all that Barnhardt said, his eyes roving meantime
over everything within the room and mentally
over many things outside it. He congratulated
Barnhardt, and when Marion came into the
room he apologized for the snow he had brought
in. Dicksie heard his voice and cried out from
the bedroom. They could not keep her away, and
she ran out to catch his hands and plead with him
not to go away. He tried to assure her that the
danger was over; that guards were now outside
everywhere, and would be until morning. But
Dicksie clung to him and would take no refusal.</p>
<p>Whispering Smith looked at her in amazement
and in admiration. &#8220;You are captain to-night,
Miss Dicksie, by Heaven. If you say the word
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_394' name='page_394'></a>394</span>
I&#8217;ll lie here on a rug till morning. But that man
will not be back to-night. You are a queen. If
I had a mountain girl that would do as much as
that for me I would&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What would you do?&#8221; asked Marion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say good-by to this accursed country forever.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLIII</h2>
<h3>CLOSING IN</h3>

<p>In the morning the sun rose with a mountain
smile. The storm had swept the air till the
ranges shone blue and the plain sparkled under a
cloudless sky. Bob Scott and Wickwire, riding at
daybreak, picked up a trail on the Fence River
road. A consultation was held at the bridge, and
within half an hour Whispering Smith, with unshaken
patience, was in the saddle and following it.</p>
<p>With him were Kennedy and Bob Scott. Sinclair
had ridden into the lines, and Whispering
Smith, with his best two men, meant to put it up
to him to ride out. They meant now to get him,
with a trail or without, and were putting horseflesh
against horseflesh and craft against craft.</p>
<p>At the forks of the Fence they picked up Wickwire,
Kennedy taking him on the up road, while
Scott with Whispering Smith crossed to the Crawling
Stone. When Smith and Scott reached the
Frenchman they parted to cover in turn each of
the trails by which it is possible to get out of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_396' name='page_396'></a>396</span>
the river country toward the Park and Williams
Cache.</p>
<p>By four o&#8217;clock in the afternoon they had all
covered the ground so well that the four were
able to make their rendezvous on the big Fence divide,
south of Crawling Stone Valley. They then
found, to their disappointment, that, widely separated
as they had been, both parties were following
trails they believed to be good. They shot a
steer, tagged it, ate dinner and supper in one, and
separated under Whispering Smith&#8217;s counsel that
both the trails be followed into the next morning&ndash;&ndash;in
the belief that one of them would run
out or that the two would run together. At
noon the next day Scott rode through the hills
from the Fence, and Kennedy with Wickwire came
through Two Feather Pass from the Frenchman
with the report that the game had left their
valleys.</p>
<p>Without rest they pushed on. At the foot of
the Mission Mountains they picked up the tracks
of a party of three horsemen. Twice within
ten miles afterward the men they were following
crossed the river. Each time their trail, with
some little difficulty, was found again. At a little
ranch in the Mission foothills, Kennedy and Scott,
leaving Wickwire with Whispering Smith, took
fresh horses and pushed ahead as far as they could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_397' name='page_397'></a>397</span>
ride before dark, but they brought back news.
The trail had split again, with one man riding
alone to the left, while two had taken the hills to
the right, heading for Mission Pass and the Cache.
With Gene Johnson and Bob at the mouth of
the Cache there was little fear for that outlet. The
turn to the left was the unexpected. Over the
little fire in the ranch kitchen where they ate supper,
the four men were in conference twenty minutes.
It was decided that Scott and Kennedy should
head for the Mission Pass, while Whispering
Smith, with Wickwire to trail with him, should
undertake to cut off, somewhere between Fence
River and the railroad, the man who had gone
south, the man believed to be Sinclair. It was a
late moon, and when Scott and Kennedy saddled
their horses Whispering Smith and Wickwire were
asleep.</p>
<p>With the cowboy, Whispering Smith started at
daybreak. No one saw them again for two days.
During those two days and nights they were in
the saddle almost continuously. For every mile
the man ahead of them rode they were forced to
ride two miles and often three. Late in the second
night they crossed the railroad, and the first
word from them came in long despatches sent by
Whispering Smith to Medicine Bend and instructions
to Kennedy and Scott in the north, which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_398' name='page_398'></a>398</span>
were carried by hard riders straight to Deep
Creek.</p>
<p>On the morning of the third day Dicksie Dunning,
who had gone home from Medicine Bend
and who had been telephoning Marion and George
McCloud two days for news, was trying to get
Medicine Bend again on the telephone when Puss
came in to say that a man at the kitchen door
wanted to see her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is it, Puss?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I d&#8217;no, Miss Dicksie; &#8217;deed, I never seen him
b&#8217;fore.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dicksie walked around on the porch to the
kitchen. A dust-covered man sitting on a limp
horse threw back the brim of his hat as he touched
it, lifted himself stiffly out of the saddle, and
dropped to the ground. He laughed at Dicksie&#8217;s
startled expression. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you know me?&#8221; he
asked, putting out his hand. It was Whispering
Smith.</p>
<p>He was a fearful sight. Stained from head to
foot with alkali, saddle-cramped and bent, his face
scratched and stained, he stood with a smiling appeal
in his bloodshot eyes.</p>
<p>Dicksie gave a little uncertain cry, clasped her
hands, and, with a scream, threw her arms impulsively
around his neck. &#8220;Oh, I did not know
you! What has happened? I am so glad to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_399' name='page_399'></a>399</span>
see you! Tell me what has happened. Are you
hurt?&#8221;</p>
<p>He stammered like a school-boy. &#8220;Nothing
has happened. What&#8217;s this? Don&#8217;t cry; nothing
at all has happened. I didn&#8217;t realize what a tramp
I look or I shouldn&#8217;t have come. But I was only
a mile away and I had heard nothing for four days
from Medicine Bend. And how are you? Did
your ride make you ill? No? By Heaven, you are
a game girl. That was a ride! How are they all?
Where&#8217;s your cousin? In town, is he? I thought
I might get some news if I rode up, and oh, Miss
Dicksie&ndash;&ndash;jiminy! some coffee. But I&#8217;ve got only
two minutes for it all, only two minutes; do you
think Puss has any on the stove?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dicksie with coaxing and pulling got him into
the kitchen, and Puss tumbled over herself to set
out coffee and rolls. He showed himself ravenously
hungry, and ate with a simple directness
that speedily accounted for everything in sight.
&#8220;You have saved my life. Now I am going, and
thank you a thousand times. There, by Heaven,
I&#8217;ve forgotten Wickwire! He is with me&ndash;&ndash;waiting
down in the cottonwoods at the fork. Could
Puss put up a lunch I could take to him? He
hasn&#8217;t had a scrap for twenty-four hours. But,
Dicksie, your tramp is a hummer! I&#8217;ve tried to
ride him down and wear him out and lose him,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_400' name='page_400'></a>400</span>
and, by Heaven, he turns up every time and has
been of more use to me than two men.&#8221;</p>
<p>She put her hand on Whispering Smith&#8217;s arm.
&#8220;I told him if he would stop drinking he could be
foreman here next season.&#8221; Puss was putting up
the lunch. &#8220;Why need you hurry away?&#8221; persisted
Dicksie. &#8220;I&#8217;ve a thousand things to say.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at her amiably. &#8220;This is really a
case of must.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, tell me, what favor may I do for you?&#8221;
She looked appealingly into his tired eyes. &#8220;I
want to do something for you. I must! don&#8217;t
deny me. Only, what shall it be?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Something for me? What can I say? You&#8217;ll
be kind to Marion&ndash;&ndash;I shouldn&#8217;t have to ask that.
What can I ask? Stop! there is one thing. I&#8217;ve
got a poor little devil of an orphan up in the Deep
Creek country. Du Sang murdered his father.
You are rich and generous, Dicksie; do something
for him, will you? Kennedy or Bob Scott will
know all about him. Bring him down here, will
you, and see he doesn&#8217;t go to the dogs? You&#8217;re a
good girl. What&#8217;s this, crying? Now you are
frightened. Things are not so bad as that. You
want to know everything&ndash;&ndash;I see it in your eyes.
Very well, let&#8217;s trade. You tell me everything and
I&#8217;ll tell you everything. Now then: Are you engaged?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_401' name='page_401'></a>401</span></div>
<p>They were standing under the low porch with
the sunshine breaking through the trees. She
turned away her face and threw all of her happiness
into a laugh. &#8220;I won&#8217;t tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s enough. You have told!&#8221; declared
Whispering Smith. &#8220;I knew&ndash;&ndash;why, of course I
knew&ndash;&ndash;but I wanted to make you own up. Well,
here&#8217;s the way things are. Sinclair has run us all
over God&#8217;s creation for two days to give his pals
a chance to break into Williams Cache to get the
Tower W money they left with Rebstock. For a
fact, we have ridden completely around Sleepy Cat
and been down in the Spanish Sinks since I saw
you. He doesn&#8217;t want to leave without the money,
and doesn&#8217;t know it is in Kennedy&#8217;s hands, and
can&#8217;t get into the Cache to find out. Now the
three&ndash;&ndash;whoever the other two are&ndash;&ndash;and Sinclair&ndash;&ndash;are
trying to join forces somewhere up this valley,
and Kennedy, Scott, Wickwire, and I are
after them; and every outlet is watched, and it
must all be over, my dear, before sunset to-night.
Isn&#8217;t that fine? I mean to have the thing wound
up somehow. Don&#8217;t look worried.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not&ndash;&ndash;do not let him kill you,&#8221; she cried
with a sob.</p>
<p>&#8220;He will not kill me; don&#8217;t be afraid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I <i>am</i> afraid. Remember what your life is to
all of us!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_402' name='page_402'></a>402</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Then, of course, I&#8217;ve got to think of what it
is to myself&ndash;&ndash;being the only one I&#8217;ve got. Sometimes
I don&#8217;t think much of it; but when I get a
welcome like this it sets me up. If I can once get
out of this accursed man-slaughtering business,
Dicksie&ndash;&ndash;How old are you? Nineteen? Well,
you&#8217;ve got the finest chap in all these mountains,
and George McCloud has the finest&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>With a bubbling laugh she shook her finger at
him. &#8220;<i>Now</i> you are caught. Say the finest
woman in these mountains if you dare! Say the
finest woman!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The finest woman of nineteen in all creation!&#8221;
He swung with a laugh into the saddle and waved
his hat. She watched him ride down the road and
around the hill. When he reappeared she was still
looking and he was galloping along the lower
road. A man rode out at the fork to meet him
and trotted with him over the bridge. Riding
leisurely across the creek, their broad hats bobbing
unevenly in the sunshine, they spurred swiftly past
the grove of quaking asps, and in a moment were
lost beyond the trees.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLIV</h2>
<h3>CRAWLING STONE WASH</h3>
</div>
<p>Where the Little Crawling Stone River
tears out of the Mission Mountains it has
left a grayish-white gap that may be seen for many
miles. This is the head of the North Crawling
Stone Valley. Twenty miles to the right the big
river itself bursts through the Mission hills in the
canyon known as the Box. Between the confluence
of Big and Little Crawling Stone, and on the east
side of Little Crawling Stone, lies a vast waste.
Standing in the midst of this frightful eruption
from the heart of the mountains, one sees, as far
as the eye can reach, a landscape utterly forbidding.
North for sixty miles lie the high chains
of the Mission range, and a cuplike configuration
of the mountains close to the valley affords a resting-place
for the deepest snows of winter and a
precipitous escape for the torrents of June. Here,
when the sun reaches its summer height or a sweet-grass
wind blows soft or a cloudburst above the
peaks strikes the southerly face of the range, winter
unfrocks in a single night. A glacier of snow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_404' name='page_404'></a>404</span>
melts within twenty-four hours into a torrent
of lava and bursts with incredible fury from a
thousand gorges.</p>
<p>When this happens nothing withstands. Whatever
lies in the path of the flood is swept from the
face of the earth. The mountains, assailed in a
moment with the ferocity of a hundred storms, are
ripped and torn like hills of clay. The frosted
scale of the granite, the desperate root of the
cedar, the poised nest of the eagle, the clutch of the
crannied vine, the split and start of the mountainside,
are all as one before the June thaw. At its
height Little Crawling Stone, with a head of forty
feet, is a choking flood of rock. Mountains, torn
and bleeding, vomit bowlders of thirty, sixty, a
hundred tons like pebbles upon the valley. Even
there they find no permanent resting-place. Each
succeeding year sees them torn groaning from their
beds in the wash. New masses of rock are hurled
upon them, new waters lift them in fresh caprice,
and the crash and the grinding echo in the hills
like a roar of mountain thunder.</p>
<p>Where the wash covers the valley nothing lives;
the fertile earth has long been buried under the
mountain <i>d&eacute;bris</i>. It supports no plant life beyond
the scantiest deposit of weed-plant seed, and the
rocky scurf, spreading like a leprosy over many
miles, scars the face of the green earth. This is the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_405' name='page_405'></a>405</span>
Crawling Stone wash. Exhausted by the fury of
its few yearly weeks of activity, Little Crawling
Stone runs for the greater part of the year a winding,
shallow stream through a bed of whitened
bowlders where lizards sun themselves and trout
lurk in shaded pools.</p>
<p>When Whispering Smith and his companions
were fairly started on the last day of their ride, it
was toward this rift in the Mission range that the
trail led them. Sinclair, with consummate cleverness,
had rejoined his companions; but the attempt
to get into the Cache, and his reckless ride into
Medicine Bend, had reduced their chances of escape
to a single outlet, and that they must find up Crawling
Stone Valley. The necessity of it was spelled
in every move the pursued men had made for
twenty-four hours. They were riding the pick of
mountain horseflesh and covering their tracks by
every device known to the high country. Behind
them, made prudent by unusual danger, rode the
best men the mountain division could muster for
the final effort to bring them to account. The fast
riding of the early week had given way to the pace
of caution. No trail sign was overlooked, no point
of concealment directly approached, no hiding-place
left unsearched.</p>
<p>The tension of a long day of this work was
drawing to a close when the sun set and left the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_406' name='page_406'></a>406</span>
big wash in the shadow of the mountains. On
the higher ground to the right, Kennedy and Scott
were riding where they could command the gullies
of the precipitous left bank of the river. High
on the left bank itself, worming his way like a
snake from point to point of concealment through
the scanty brush of the mountainside, crawled
Wickwire, commanding the pockets in the right
bank. Closer to the river on the right and following
the trail itself over shale and rock and between
scattered bowlders, Whispering Smith, low
on his horse&#8217;s neck, rode slowly.</p>
<p>It was almost too dark to catch the slight discolorations
where pebbles had been disturbed on a
flat surface or the calk of a horseshoe had slipped
on the uneven face of a ledge, and he had halted
under an uplift to wait for Wickwire on the distant
left to advance, when, half a mile below him,
a horseman crossing the river rode slowly past a
gap in the rocks and disappeared below the next
bend. He was followed in a moment by a second
rider and a third. Whispering Smith knew he
had not been seen. He had flushed the game, and,
wheeling his horse, rode straight up the river-bank
to high ground, where he could circle around
widely below them. They had slipped between
his line and Wickwire&#8217;s, and were doubling back,
following the dry bed of the stream. It was impossible
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_407' name='page_407'></a>407</span>
to recall Kennedy and Scott without giving
an alarm, but by a quick <i>d&eacute;tour</i> he could at
least hold the quarry back for twenty minutes with
his rifle, and in that time Kennedy and Scott could
come up.</p>
<p>Less than half an hour of daylight remained. If
the outlaws could slip down the wash and out into
the Crawling Stone Valley they had every chance
of getting away in the night; and if the third man
should be Barney Rebstock, Whispering Smith
knew that Sinclair thought only of escape. Smith
alone, of their pursuers, could now intercept them,
but a second hope remained: on the left, Wickwire
was high enough to command every turn in
the bed of the river. He might see them and could
force them to cover with his rifle even at long
range. Casting up the chances, Whispering Smith,
riding faster over the uneven ground than anything
but sheer recklessness would have prompted,
hastened across the waste. His rifle lay in his
hand, and he had pushed his horse to a run. A
single fearful instinct crowded now upon the long
strain of the week. A savage fascination burned
like a fever in his veins, and he meant that they
should not get away. Taking chances that would
have shamed him in cooler moments, he forced his
horse at the end of the long ride to within a hundred
paces of the river, threw his lines, slipped like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_408' name='page_408'></a>408</span>
a lizard from the saddle, and, darting with incredible
swiftness from rock to rock, gained the water&#8217;s
edge.</p>
<p>From up the long shadows of the wash there
came the wail of an owl. From it he knew that
Wickwire had seen them and was warning him, but
he had anticipated the warning and stood below
where the hunted men must ride. He strained
his eyes over the waste of rock above. For one
half-hour of daylight he would have sold, in that
moment, ten years of his life. What could he do
if they should be able to secrete themselves until
dark between him and Wickwire? Gliding under
cover of huge rocks up the dry watercourse, he
reached a spot where the floods had scooped a
long, hollow curve out of a soft ledge in the bank,
leaving a stretch of smooth sand on the bed of the
stream. At the upper point great bowlders pushed
out in the river. He could not inspect the curve
from the spot he had gained without reckless exposure,
but he must force the little daylight left
to him. Climbing completely over the lower point,
he advanced cautiously, and from behind a sheltering
spur stepped out upon an overhanging table of
rock and looked across the river-bottom. Three
men had halted on the sand within the curve. Two
lay on their rifles under the upper point, a hundred
and twenty paces from Whispering Smith.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_409' name='page_409'></a>409</span>
The third man, Seagrue, less than fifty yards away,
had got off his horse and was laying down his
rifle, when the hoot-owl screeched again and he
looked uneasily back. They had chosen for
their halt a spot easily defended, and needed
only darkness to make them safe, when Smith,
stepping out into plain sight, threw forward his
hand.</p>
<p>They heard his sharp call to pitch up, and the
men under the point jumped. Seagrue had not
yet taken his hand from his rifle. He threw it to
his shoulder. As closely together as two fingers
of the right hand can be struck twice in the palm
of the left, two rifle-shots cracked across the wash.
Two bullets passed so close in flight they might
have struck. One cut the dusty hair from Smith&#8217;s
temple and slit the brim of his hat above his
ear; the other struck Seagrue under the left eye,
ploughed through the roof of his mouth, and,
coming out below his ear, splintered the rock at
his back.</p>
<p>The shock alone would have staggered a bullock,
but Seagrue, laughing, came forward pumping
his gun. Sinclair, at a hundred and twenty
yards, cut instantly into the fight, and the ball from
his rifle creased the alkali that crusted Whispering
Smith&#8217;s unshaven cheek. As he fired he sprang
to cover.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_410' name='page_410'></a>410</span></div>
<p>For Seagrue and Smith there was no cover: for
one or both it was death in the open and Seagrue,
with his rifle at his cheek, walked straight into it.
Taking for a moment the fire of the three guns,
Whispering Smith stood, a perfect target, outlined
against the sky. They whipped the dust from his
coat, tore the sleeve from his wrist, and ripped
the blouse collar from his neck; but he felt no
bullet shock. He saw before him only the buckle
of Seagrue&#8217;s belt forty paces away, and sent bullet
after bullet at the gleam of brass between the
sights. Both men were using high-pressure guns,
and the deadly shock of the slugs made Seagrue
twitch and stagger. The man was dying as he
walked. Smith&#8217;s hand was racing with the lever,
and had a cartridge jammed, the steel would have
snapped like a match.</p>
<p>It was beyond human endurance to support the
leaden death. The little square of brass between
the sights wavered. Seagrue stumbled, doubled on
his knees, and staggering plunged loosely forward
on the sand. Whispering Smith threw his fire
toward the bowlder behind which Sinclair and
Barney Rebstock had disappeared.</p>
<p>Suddenly he realized that the bullets from the
point were not coming his way. He was aware
of a second rifle-duel above the bend. Wickwire,
worming his way down the stream, had uncovered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_411' name='page_411'></a>411</span>
Sinclair and young Rebstock from behind. A yell
between the shots rang across the wash, and the
cringing figure of a man ran out toward Whispering
Smith with his hands high in the air, and
pitched headlong on the ground. It was the
skulker, Barney Rebstock, driven out by Wickwire&#8217;s
fire.</p>
<p>The, shooting ceased. Silence fell upon the
gloom of the dusk. Then came a calling between
Smith and Wickwire, and a signalling of pistol-shots
for their companions. Kennedy and Bob
Scott dashed down toward the river-bed on their
horses. Seagrue lay on his face. Young Rebstock
sat with his hands around his knees on the
sand. Above him at some distance, Wickwire and
Smith stood before a man who leaned against the
sharp cheek of the bowlder at the point. In his
hands his rifle was held across his lap just as he
had dropped on his knee to fire. He had never
moved after he was struck. His head, drooping
a little, rested against the rock, and his hat lay on
the sand; his heavy beard had sunk into his chest
and he kneeled in the shadow, asleep. Scott and
Kennedy knew him. In the mountains there was
no double for Murray Sinclair.</p>
<p>When he jumped behind the point to pick Whispering
Smith off the ledge he had laid himself
directly under Wickwire&#8217;s fire across the wash.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_412' name='page_412'></a>412</span>
The first shot of the cowboy at two hundred yards
had passed, as he knelt, through both temples.</p>
<p>They laid him at Seagrue&#8217;s side. The camp
was made beside the dead men in the wash. &#8220;You
had better not take him to Medicine Bend,&#8221; said
Whispering Smith, sitting late with Kennedy before
the dying fire. &#8220;It would only mean that
much more unpleasant talk and notoriety for her.
The inquest can be held on the Frenchman. Take
him to his own ranch and telegraph the folks in
Wisconsin&ndash;&ndash;God knows whether they will want
to hear. But his mother is there yet. But if half
what Barney has told to-night is true it would be
better if no one ever heard.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLV</h2>
<h3>BACK TO THE MOUNTAINS</h3>
</div>
<p>In the cottage in Boney Street, one year later,
two women were waiting. It was ten o&#8217;clock
at night.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it a shame to be disappointed like this?&#8221;
complained Dicksie, pushing her hair impatiently
back. &#8220;Really, poor George is worked to death.
He was to be in at six o&#8217;clock, Mr. Lee said, and
here it is ten, and all your beautiful dinner spoiled.
Marion, are you keeping something from me?
Look me in the eye. Have you heard from Gordon
Smith?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Dicksie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not since he left the mountains a year ago?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not since he left the mountains a year ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dicksie, sitting forward in her chair, bent her
eyes upon the fire. &#8220;It is so strange. I wonder
where he is to-night. How he loves you, Marion!
He told me everything when he said good-by. He
made me promise not to tell then; but I didn&#8217;t
promise to keep it forever.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_414' name='page_414'></a>414</span></div>
<p>Marion smiled. &#8220;A year isn&#8217;t forever, Dicksie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s pretty near forever when you are in
love,&#8221; declared Dicksie energetically. &#8220;I know
just how he felt,&#8221; she went on in a quieter tone.
&#8220;He felt that all the disagreeable excitement and
talk we had here then bore heaviest on you. He
said if he stayed in Medicine Bend the newspapers
never would cease talking and people never would
stop annoying you&ndash;&ndash;and you know George did say
they were asking to have passenger trains held here
just so people could see Whispering Smith. And,
Marion, think of it, he actually doesn&#8217;t know yet
that George and I are married! How could we
notify him without knowing where he was? And
he doesn&#8217;t know that trains are running up the
Crawling Stone Valley. Mercy! a year goes like
an hour when you&#8217;re in love, doesn&#8217;t it? George
said he <i>knew</i> we should hear from him within six
months&ndash;&ndash;and George has never yet been mistaken
excepting when he said I should grow to like the
railroad business&ndash;&ndash;and now it is a year and no
news from him.&#8221; Dicksie sprang from her chair.
&#8220;I am going to call up Mr. Rooney Lee and just
demand my husband! I think Mr. Lee handles
trains shockingly every time George tries to get
home like this on Saturday nights&ndash;&ndash;now don&#8217;t you?
And passenger trains ought to get out of the way,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_415' name='page_415'></a>415</span>
anyway, when a division superintendent is trying to
get home. What difference does it make to a
passenger, I&#8217;d like to know, whether he is a few
hours less or longer in getting to California or
Japan or Manila or Hongkong or Buzzard&#8217;s
Gulch, provided he is safe&ndash;&ndash;and you know there
has not been an accident on the division for a
year, Marion. There&#8217;s a step now. I&#8217;ll bet that&#8217;s
George!&#8221;</p>
<p>The door opened and it was George.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, honey!&#8221; cried Dicksie softly, waving her
arms as she stood an instant before she ran to him.
&#8220;But haven&#8217;t I been a-waitin&#8217; for you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Too bad! and, Marion,&#8221; he exclaimed, turning
without releasing his wife from his arms, &#8220;how
can I ever make good for all this delay? Oh, yes,
I&#8217;ve had dinner. Never, for Heaven&#8217;s sake, wait
dinner for me! But wait, both of you, till you
hear the news!&#8221;</p>
<p>Dicksie kept her hands on his shoulders. &#8220;You
have heard from Whispering Smith!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait till I get it straight. Mr. Bucks is here&ndash;&ndash;I
came in with him in his car. He has news
of Whispering Smith. One of our freight-traffic
men in the Puget Sound country, who has been
in a hospital in Victoria, learned by the merest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_416' name='page_416'></a>416</span>
accident that Gordon Smith was lying in the same
hospital with typhoid fever.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marion rose swiftly. &#8220;Then the time has come,
thank God, when I can do something for him; and
I am going to him to-night!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine!&#8221; cried McCloud. &#8220;So am I, and that
is why I&#8217;m late.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I am going, too,&#8221; exclaimed Dicksie
solemnly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean it?&#8221; asked her husband. &#8220;Shall
we let her, Marion? Mr. Bucks says I am to
take his car and take Barnhardt, and keep the
car there till I can bring Gordon back. Mr.
Bucks and his secretary will ride to-night as
far as Bear Dance with us, and in the morning
they join Mr. Glover there.&#8221; McCloud looked
at his watch. &#8220;If you are both going, can
you be ready by twelve o&#8217;clock for the China
Mail?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can be ready in an hour,&#8221; declared Dicksie,
throwing her arm half around Marion&#8217;s neck,
&#8220;can&#8217;t we, Marion?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can be ready in thirty minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, by Heaven&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; McCloud studied his
watch.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, George?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t wait for the midnight train. We
will take an engine, run special to Green River,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_417' name='page_417'></a>417</span>
overhaul the Coast Limited, and save a whole
day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;George, pack your suit-case&ndash;&ndash;quick, dear; and
you, too, Marion; suit-cases are all we can take,&#8221;
cried Dicksie, pushing her husband toward the bedroom.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll telephone Rooney Lee for an engine
myself right away. Dear me, it is kind of nice,
to be able to order up a train when you want one
in a hurry, isn&#8217;t it, Marion? Perhaps I <i>shall</i> come
to like it if they ever make George a vice-president.&#8221;</p>
<p>In half an hour they had joined Bucks in his
car, and Bill Dancing was piling the baggage into
the vestibule. Bucks was sitting down to coffee.
Chairs had been provided at the table, and
after the greetings, Bucks, seating Marion Sinclair
at his right and Barnhardt and McCloud at his left,
asked Dicksie to sit opposite and pour the coffee.
&#8220;You are a railroad man&#8217;s wife now and you must
learn to assume responsibility.&#8221;</p>
<p>McCloud looked apprehensive. &#8220;I am afraid
she will be assuming the whole division if you encourage
her too much, Mr. Bucks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Marrying a railroad man,&#8221; continued Bucks,
pursuing his own thought, &#8220;is as bad as marrying
into the army; if you have your husband half the
time you are lucky. Then, too, in the railroad
business your husband may have to be set back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_418' name='page_418'></a>418</span>
when the traffic falls off. It&#8217;s a little light at this
moment, too. How should you take it if we had
to put him on a freight train for a while, Mrs.
McCloud?"</p>
<p>"Oh, Mr. Bucks!"</p>
<p>"Or suppose he should be promoted and should
have to go to headquarters&ndash;&ndash;some of us are getting
old, you know."</p>
<p>"Really," Dicksie looked most demure as she
filled the president&#8217;s cup, "really, I often say to
Mr. McCloud that I can not believe Mr. Bucks is
president of this great road. He always looks to
me to be the youngest man on the whole executive
staff. Two lumps of sugar, Mr. Bucks?"</p>
<p>The bachelor president rolled his eyes as he
reached for his cup. "Thank you, Mrs. McCloud,
only one after that." He looked toward
Marion. "All I can say is that if Mrs. McCloud&#8217;s
husband had married her two years earlier
he might have been general manager by this time.
Nothing could hold a man back, even a man of
his modesty, whose wife can say as nice things as
that. By the way, Mrs. Sinclair, does this man
keep you supplied with transportation?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I have my annual, Mr. Bucks!" Marion
opened her bag to find it.</p>
<p>Bucks held out his hand. "Let me see it a moment."
He adjusted his eye-glasses, looked at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_419' name='page_419'></a>419</span>
pass, and called for a pen; Bucks had never lost his
gracious way of doing very little things. He laid
the card on the table and wrote across the back of
it over his name: "Good on all passenger trains."
When he handed the card back to Marion he
turned to Dicksie. "I understand you are laying
out two or three towns on the ranch, Mrs.
McCloud?"</p>
<p>"Two or three! Oh, no, only one as yet, Mr.
Bucks! They are laying out, oh, such a pretty
town! Cousin Lance is superintending the street
work&ndash;&ndash;and whom do you think I am going to
name it after? You! I think &#8217;Bucks&#8217; makes a
dandy name for a town, don&#8217;t you? And I am
going to have one town named Dunning; there will
be two stations on the ranch, you know, and I think,
really, there <i>ought</i> to be three."</p>
<p>"As many as that?"</p>
<p>"I don&#8217;t believe you can operate a line that
long, Mr. Bucks, with stations fourteen miles
apart." Bucks opened his eyes in benevolent surprise.
Dicksie, unabashed, kept right on: "Well,
do you know how traffic is increasing over there,
with the trains running only two months now?
Why, the settlers are fairly pouring into the
country."</p>
<p>"Will you give me a corner lot if we put
another station on the ranch?"
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_420' name='page_420'></a>420</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I will give you two if you will give us excursions
and run some of the Overland passenger
trains through the valley.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bucks threw back his head and laughed in his
tremendous way. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know about that; I
daren&#8217;t promise offhand, Mrs. McCloud. But if
you can get Whispering Smith to come back you
might lay the matter before him. He is to take
charge of all the colonist business when he returns;
he promised to do that before he went away for
his vacation. Whispering Smith is really the man
you will have to stand in with.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Whispering Smith, lying on his iron bed in the
hospital, professed not to be able quite to understand
why they had made such a fuss about it.
He underwent the excitement of the appearance
of Barnhardt and the first talk with McCloud and
Dicksie with hardly a rise in his temperature, and,
lying in the sunshine of the afternoon, he was
waiting for Marion. When she opened the door
his face was turned wistfully toward it. He held
out his hands with the old smile. She ran half
blinded across the room and dropped on her knee
beside him.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Marion, why did they drag you
away out here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They did not drag me away out here. Did
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_421' name='page_421'></a>421</span>
you expect me to sit with folded hands when I
heard you were ill anywhere in the wide world?&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked hungrily at her. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t suppose
any one in the wide world would take it very seriously.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. McCloud is crushed this afternoon to
think you have said you would not go back with
him. You would not believe how he misses you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It has been pretty lonesome for the last year.
I didn&#8217;t think it <i>could</i> be so lonesome anywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor did I.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you noticed it? I shouldn&#8217;t think you
could in the mountains. Was there much water
last spring? Heavens, I&#8217;d like to see the Crawling
Stone again!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you come back?&#8221;</p>
<p>He folded her hands in his own. &#8220;Marion, it
is you. I&#8217;ve been afraid I couldn&#8217;t stand it to be
near you and not tell you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What need you be afraid to tell me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That I have loved you so long.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her head sunk close to his. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you know
you have said it to me many times without words?
I&#8217;ve only been waiting for a chance to tell you
how happy it makes me to think it is true.&#8221;</p>
